## Code Snippet Summary

>[!important]


## Code

```
following the Lean Product Playbook and  Principle, compare three philosophies 

1. Target Customer (two: developer, user)
2. Unerstand their Needs (e.g. developer: expanding the pipeline; user: execution of pipeline);  
	- In this section: 
		- Write customer need explictly
		- Create a user story using template like "As a [type of user], I want to [do something], so that I can [desired benefit]."
		- Understand and Summarize the pain points.
	- Examples:
		- for user is lack of automatic robust pipeline generation system. esp. it should handle step building and dependency resolution automatically ; 
	    - for developer, beside the same concern as user, developer also feel there lacks of agile, flexible, robust system so that develop can add new steps and handle new tasks without breaking the system. 
3. Value Proposition: - how each philosophy solve the user concern? - how they prioritze different customer needs?- how they address important customer needs
4. *Minimum Viable Product (MVP) candidate: go over existing design components in slipbox/pipeline_design.Based on customer need, evaluate their relevance and importance to meet the customer need and solve the pain points
