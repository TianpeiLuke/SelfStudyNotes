## Code Snippet Summary

>[!important]
>Provide some examples that use `awk` to parse csv file

## Code

### Count the number of Columns

![[Count Number of Columns in CSV file#^48d329]]

- [[Count Number of Columns in CSV file]]

### Extract Specific Column

>[!example] 
> Prints the second column of every row in the CSV file:
> 
> ```bash
> awk -F, '{print $2}' file.csv
> ```
> 

- The command splits each line using commas.
- `$2` refers to the second field, which is printed for every line.

- [[Extract Columns in CSV and Ignore delimiter in double quotes]]


### Filter Rows Based on a Column Value

>[!example] 
> Prints rows where the third column matches a specific value (e.g., `"someValue"`):
> ```bash
> awk -F, '$3 == "someValue" {print}' file.csv
> ```
> 

- The condition `$3 == "someValue"` checks if the third field equals `"someValue"`.
- Only rows that meet the condition are printed.


### Sum a Numeric Column (Skipping the Header)

> [!example]
> Sums the values in the fourth column, ignoring the header row:
> ```bash
> awk -F, 'NR > 1 {sum += $4} END {print sum}' file.csv
> ```
>  

- `NR > 1` skips the header.
- `sum += $4` adds the value of the fourth column for each subsequent line.
- `END {print sum}` outputs the total sum after processing all rows.


### Handling Quoted Fields with GNU AWK (gawk) Using FPAT

> [!example]
> For CSV files with fields enclosed in quotes (which may contain commas), you can use GNU AWK's `FPAT`:
> ```bash
> gawk 'BEGIN { FPAT = "([^,]+)|(\"[^\"]+\")" } { print $1, $2, $3 }' file.csv
> ```

- `FPAT` defines a *field pattern* that matches either a *sequence* of *non-comma characters* or *a quoted string*.
- This approach helps correctly parse fields that *contain commas within quotes*.
- The command prints the first three fields for each row.


### Process Header Row and Print Selected Columns

> [!example]
> Stores the header fields and then prints the first and third columns for the remaining rows:
> ```bash
> awk -F, 'NR==1 {for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) header[i]=$i; next} {print $1, $3}' file.csv
> ```
> 

- For the header row (`NR==1`), the `for` loop stores each header value in an array.
- `next` skips to the next record after processing the header.
- For subsequent rows, the command prints the first and third columns.
