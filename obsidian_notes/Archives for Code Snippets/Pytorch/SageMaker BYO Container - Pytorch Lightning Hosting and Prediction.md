## Code Snippet Summary

>[!important] 
>The tasks for a typical predictor script:
> - create **Flask app**
> - handle *HTTP GET request* to **`/ping` endpoint**.
> 	- **load** trained model from S3 location; 
> 	- check for health.
> - handle *HTTP POST request* to **`/invocations`  endpoint**.
> 	- **load** data from HTTP invocation;
> 	- **configure** pipeline for preprocessing
> 	- **predict** output
> 	- **send** output to caller via HTTP invocation


>[!important]
>**Requirements for inference containers**
>To respond to inference requests, your container must meet the following requirements:
> 
> - SageMaker strips all `POST` headers except those supported by `InvokeEndpoint`. SageMaker might add additional headers. Inference containers must be able to safely ignore these additional headers.
>     
> - To receive inference requests, the container must have a web server listening on port **8080** and must accept **`POST` requests** to the **`/invocations` and `/ping` endpoints**.
>     
> - A customer's model containers must accept socket connection requests **within 250 ms.**
>     
> - A customer's model containers must *respond to requests* **within 60 seconds**. The model itself can have a **maximum processing time of 60 seconds** before responding to the `/invocations`. *If your model is going to take 50-60 seconds of processing time, the SDK socket timeout should be set to be 70 seconds.*

## Background Knowledge
### The parts of a sample container

- In the `container` directory are all the components you need to package the sample algorithm for Amazon SageMager:

```
.
|-- Dockerfile
|-- build_and_push.sh
`-- model
    |-- nginx.conf
    |-- predictor.py
    |-- serve
    |-- train
    `-- wsgi.py
```

- Let's discuss each of these in turn:
	* **`Dockerfile`** describes how to build your Docker container image. More details below.
	* **`build_and_push.sh`** is a script that uses the Dockerfile to build your container images and then pushes it to ECR. We'll invoke the commands directly later in this notebook, but you can just copy and run the script for your own algorithms.
	* **`model`** is the directory which contains the files that will be installed in the container.
	* **`local_test`** is a directory that shows how to test your new container on any computer that can run **Docker**, including an **Amazon SageMaker** *notebook instance*. Using this method, you can quickly iterate using small datasets to eliminate any structural bugs before you use the container with Amazon SageMaker. We'll walk through local testing later in this notebook.

The files that we'll put in the container are:
* __`nginx.conf`__ is the configuration file for the nginx front-end. Generally, you should be able to take this file as-is.
* __`predictor.py`__ is the program that actually implements the **Flask web server** and the predictions for this app. You'll want to *customize the actual prediction parts* to your application. Since this algorithm is simple, we do all the processing here in this file, but you may choose to have separate files for implementing your custom logic.
* __`serve`__ is the program started *when the container is started for **hosting***. It simply launches the gunicorn server which runs multiple instances of the Flask app defined in `predictor.py`. You should be able to take this file as-is.
* __`train`__ is the program that is invoked *when the container is run for **training***. You will modify this program to implement your training algorithm.
* __`wsgi.py`__ is a small wrapper used to invoke the Flask app. You should be able to take this file as-is.

In summary, the two files you will probably want to change for your application are `train` and `predictor.py`.

## Code

### Predictor 

#### Create Flask App

```python
import flask

# The flask app for serving predictions
app = flask.Flask(__name__)
```

- `flask.Flask()`: the application object. [reference](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Flask)
	- The idea of the **first parameter** is to give Flask an idea of *what belongs to your application.* This name is used to *find resources on the filesystem*, can be used by extensions to improve debugging information and a lot more.
	- If you are using a single module, `__name__` is always the correct value. 
	- If you however are using a package, itâ€™s usually recommended to hardcode the name of your package there.

- [How Your Container Should Response to Inference Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-inference-code.html#your-algorithms-inference-code-container-response)

>To receive inference requests, the container must have a web server listening on port **8080** and must accept **`POST` requests** to the **`/invocations`** and **`/ping` endpoints.**

#### Handle requests to `/ping` endpoint

```python

prefix = '/opt/ml/'
model_path = os.path.join(prefix, 'model')

@app.route('/ping', methods=['GET'])
def ping():
    """Determine if the container is working and healthy. In this sample container, we declare
    it healthy if we can load the model and pipeline successfully.
    """
    # You can insert a health check here
    health = ScoringService.load_model_pipeline(model_path) is not None  
        
    status = 200 if health else 404
    return flask.Response(response='\n', status=status, mimetype='application/json')
```

- `@app.route()`: **Decorate a view function** to register it with the given URL rule and options. [reference](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Flask.route)
	- Calls [`add_url_rule()`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Flask.add_url_rule "flask.Flask.add_url_rule"), which has more details about the implementation.
	- `add_url_rule()` function: Register a rule for routing incoming requests and building URLs. [reference](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Flask.add_url_rule)'
	- **'/ping'** is the endpoint that received an **HTTP GET request**. 
		- An *HTTP GET request* checks that there is a web server running on the host, that it answers to a given IP/port/hostname combo, that you asked it for a valid URL and that the web site is able to answer your request.
		- [How Your Container Should Response to Inference Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-inference-code.html#your-algorithms-inference-code-container-response)
	- `method`: for `/ping` it is *'GET' method*; for `/invocations` it is *'POST' method*
	- See [URL Route Registrations](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#url-route-registrations).
	  
- `flask.Response()`: [reference](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#response-objects)
	- The response object that is used by default in Flask. Works like the response object from **Werkzeug** but is set to have an *HTML mimetype* by default.
	- **`response`**: output string. 
	- **`mimetype`**: `application/json`, `text/csv`, `text/tsv`
		- For our applications, we accept **csv** or **json** format. `application/json`, `text/csv` as input and output
	- **`status`**: *Healthy* (**200**),  *Unhealthy* (**404**)


- `ScoringService` is an user-defined module which stored models and pipeline and do inference.

>[!task]
> - `ScoringService.load_model_pipeline(model_path)` need to complete the following tasks
> 	- Amazon Sagemaker would download `model.tar.gz` from S3 bucket and uncompress it to `opt/ml/model` at the beginning of endpoint deployment
> 	- **load** `model.pth` and `model_artifacts.pth` from `opt/ml/model`
> 	- **reconstruct** trained model from loaded paramaters in `model.pth` and `model_artifacts.pth` 
> 	- **reconstruct** the preprocessing pipeline (tokenizer, cleaner etc.) from `model_artifacts.pth`
> 	- save loaded model and pipeline to variables that can be used in other functions.
> 	- If the reconstructions are successful, return `True` else `False`.


>[!important]
>**How Your Container Should Respond to Health Check (Ping) Requests**
>- Soon after container startup, SageMaker starts sending periodic GET requests to the `/ping` endpoint.
>- If healthy, respond with an **HTTP 200 status code**. This indicates to SageMaker that the container is ready to accept inference requests at the `/invocations` endpoint.
>- If the container does not begin to pass health checks by consistently **responding with 200s during the 8 minutes after startup**, the new instance launch **fails**. 
>- While the *minimum bar* is for the container to return a static *200*, a container developer can use this functionality to perform deeper checks. 
>- **The request timeout** on `/ping` attempts is **2 seconds.**
>  
>-- [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-inference-code.html#your-algorithms-inference-algo-ping-requests)


#### Handle requests to `/invocations` endpoint

```python
from io import StringIO

@app.route('/invocations', methods=['POST'])
def transformation():
    """Do an inference on a single batch of data. In this sample server, we take data as CSV, convert it to a pandas data frame for internal use and then convert the predictions back to CSV (which really just means one prediction per line, since there's a single column.
    """
    start_time = time.time()
    data = None
    is_batch = False 
    skip_header = True  

    # Convert from CSV to pandas
    # for 'text/csv', only allowed for one record
    if flask.request.content_type in 'text/csv':
        data = flask.request.get_data(as_text=True) # as_text=True return value will be decoded string
        #convert pandas.to_string back to pandas through StringIO
        if skip_header:
            data = pd.read_csv(StringIO(data), header=None, index_col=None)
        else:
            data = pd.read_csv(StringIO(data), index_col=None)   
    else:
        return flask.Response(response='This predictor only supports CSV data', status=415, mimetype='text/plain') 
    
    logger.info('Invoked with {} records'.format(len(data)))
    batch_size = data.shape[0]
    
    # Do the prediction   
    predictions = ScoringService.predict(data, batch_size, skip_header, 'pred')
    logger.info("Score: {}".format(predictions))
    
    # Convert from numpy back to CSV
    out = StringIO()
    pd.DataFrame({'results':predictions}).to_csv(out, header=False, index=False)
    result = out.getvalue()
    logger.info("Score sending succeeded")
    logger.info("Execution latency "+str(time.time()-start_time))

    return flask.Response(response=result, status=200, mimetype='text/csv')
```

- `@app.route()`:
	- To obtain inferences, the client application sends a **POST request** to the SageMaker endpoint.
	- **'/invocations'** is the endpoint that received an **HTTP POST request** for inference. 
	- Client call endpoint via [InvokeEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeEndpoint.html) API. 
	- [How Your Container Should Response to Inference Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-inference-code.html#your-algorithms-inference-code-container-response)

- `flask.request`: [reference](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Request)
	- It is what ends up as [`request`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.request "flask.request").
	- `content_type`: The **Content-Type entity-header field** indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient. e.g. `application/json`, `text/csv`, `text/plain`. [reference]([http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml))
	- `mimetype`: Like [`content_type`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Request.content_type "flask.Request.content_type"), but without parameters (eg, without charset, type etc.) and always lowercase. [reference](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Request.mimetype)
	- `get_data()`: This reads the buffered incoming data from the client into one bytes object. [reference](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Request.get_data)
		- Usually itâ€™s a bad idea to call this method without checking the content length first as a client could send dozens of megabytes or more to cause memory problems on the server.
		- If `as_text` is set to `True` the return value will be a **decoded string**. 
	- `get_json()`: Parse [`data`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Request.data "flask.Request.data") as JSON. Need to have `flask.request.content_type` as `application/json`. See [reference](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#flask.Request.get_json)
	  
- `flask.Response`: [reference](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#response-objects)
	- Same as `/ping` endpoint
	- **`status`**: *Healthy* (**200**),  *Unhealthy* (**404**)
	- For our applications, we accept **csv** or **json** format. `application/json`, `text/csv` as both **input** and **output**


>[!task]
>- `ScoringService.predict()` need to complete the following tasks
>	- input 
>		- **tabular formatted data** with text and tabular fields 
>		- control parameters
>	- **preprocess** of input text and tabular fields
>	- `ScoringService` stored the model and pipeline since first launch
>	- **call** model inference method to predict on input
>	- **save** prediction results to text
>	- **response** inference requests with the prediction results in text

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# This file implements the scoring service shell. You don't necessarily need to modify it for various
# algorithms. It starts nginx and gunicorn with the correct configurations and then simply waits until
# gunicorn exits.
