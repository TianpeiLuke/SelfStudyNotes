## Code Snippet Summary

>[!important]
>Call multi-thread package to process rows of pandas data frame in concurrent setup


## Code

```python
import pandas as pd 
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
```

- process single row

```python
def process_single_row(...):
	...
```

- process multiple rows in concurrent setup 

```python
def batch_process_dataframe(
    df: pd.DataFrame,
    batch_size: int = 10,
    max_workers: int = 5,
    max_retries: int = 5
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Process DataFrame in batches with parallel execution
    
    Args:
        df: Input DataFrame with required columns
        batch_size: Number of rows to process in each batch
        max_workers: Maximum number of concurrent threads
        max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts for each API call
    
    Returns:
        DataFrame with analysis results
    """
    results = []
    
    # Process in batches
    for batch_start in range(0, len(df), batch_size):
        batch_end = min(batch_start + batch_size, len(df))
        batch_df = df.iloc[batch_start:batch_end]
        batch_results = []
        
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
            future_to_row = {
                executor.submit(
                    process_single_row,
                    ...
                ): idx for idx, row in batch_df.iterrows()
            }
            
            for future in as_completed(future_to_row):
                idx = future_to_row[future]
                try:
                    result = future.result()
                    batch_results.append({...})
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error processing row {idx}: {str(e)}")
                    batch_results.append({...})
        
        results.extend(batch_results)
```

### 1. Where Multi-threading Happens

```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
    future_to_row = {
        executor.submit(
            process_single_row,
            ...
        ): idx for idx, row in batch_df.iterrows()
    }

    for future in as_completed(future_to_row):
        ...
```

- `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)` → starts a thread pool that can run **up to 5 tasks concurrently** (you can change `max_workers`).
    
- `executor.submit(...)` → schedules each `process_single_row` call to be executed in its own thread.
    
- `future_to_row` → maps each future (the scheduled task) to the row index it processes.
    
- `as_completed(future_to_row)` → yields futures **as they complete**, allowing you to process results as they come in.

### 2. Why Use Threads Here?

Because `process_single_row` involves **network-bound work** (likely an API call to Claude via `analyze_dialogue_with_claude()`), multithreading can:

- Run multiple API calls in parallel.
    
- Avoid waiting for I/O (since Python threads can work around the GIL for I/O).
    
- Greatly **speed up throughput** when processing thousands of rows.


### 3. What Happens After Threads Finish?

As each thread finishes, this code handles it:

```python
for future in as_completed(future_to_row):
    idx = future_to_row[future]
    try:
        result = future.result()
        batch_results.append({...})
    except Exception as e:
        batch_results.append({...})  # Log error for this row
```

This ensures:

- Success: You get the processed result and associate it with the correct row index.
    
- Failure: You catch the exception and generate a fallback "error" analysis.

### 4. How Batching Works

The DataFrame is processed in batches:

```python
for batch_start in range(0, len(df), batch_size):     ...
```

This:

- Limits how many rows are processed per thread pool cycle
    
- Adds a `time.sleep(1)` delay between batches to avoid rate-limiting
