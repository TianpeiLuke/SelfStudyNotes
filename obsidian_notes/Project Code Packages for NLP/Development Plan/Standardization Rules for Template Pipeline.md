Based on the new declarative specification system with node types and enhanced dependency management, I can see how the standardization rules need to evolve. The new architecture introduces several improvements that should be reflected in updated rules. Here's my proposed enhancement:

## Enhanced Standardization Rules for the Universal Pipeline

The evolution from imperative to declarative pipeline construction, combined with the introduction of node types and specification-driven development, has led to the establishment of these enhanced standardization rules, summarized as the **"Enhanced Standard Pattern"**:

### **1. Declarative Specification Management:**

- **Step Specifications**: Each step type must have a corresponding `StepSpecification` that declaratively defines:
  - **Node Type**: Classification as SOURCE, INTERNAL, SINK, or SINGULAR
  - **Dependencies**: Required and optional inputs with semantic metadata
  - **Outputs**: Available outputs with multiple aliases for compatibility
  - **Validation Rules**: Automatic constraint enforcement based on node type

- **Specification Registry**: All step specifications must be registered in the global registry to enable:
  - Automatic compatibility checking
  - Dynamic dependency resolution
  - Pipeline validation

### **2. Enhanced Input/Output Management:**

- **Multi-Alias Output Specifications**: Each logical output should provide multiple aliases to accommodate different naming conventions:
  - Primary logical name (snake_case): `processed_data`
  - Descriptive alias (PascalCase): `ProcessedTabularData`
  - Common alternative aliases: `model_data`, `output_path`, etc.

- **Semantic Dependency Matching**: Dependencies should include:
  - **Compatible Sources**: List of step types that can provide this dependency
  - **Semantic Keywords**: Keywords for intelligent matching
  - **Data Type**: Expected data format (S3Uri, String, etc.)

- **Property Path Mapping**: Each output specification must include the exact SageMaker property path for runtime resolution

### **3. Node Type-Aware Pipeline Construction:**

- **SOURCE Nodes** (e.g., Data Loading):
  - Must have zero dependencies
  - Must provide at least one output
  - Serve as pipeline entry points

- **INTERNAL Nodes** (e.g., Processing, Training):
  - Must have at least one dependency
  - Must provide at least one output
  - Form the processing backbone

- **SINK Nodes** (e.g., Model Registration):
  - Must have at least one dependency
  - Must have zero outputs (side effects only)
  - Serve as pipeline endpoints

- **SINGULAR Nodes** (e.g., Standalone Operations):
  - Must have zero dependencies
  - Must have zero outputs
  - Operate independently

### **4. Configuration Storage & Management:**

- **Hierarchical Configuration Structure**:
  - **Global Shared**: Values identical across all configurations
  - **Type Shared**: Values shared within node type categories (e.g., all processing steps)
  - **Step Specific**: Values unique to individual step instances
  - **Environment Specific**: Values that vary by deployment environment

- **Configuration Validation**: Each configuration class must:
  - Implement specification-compliant validation
  - Provide clear error messages for constraint violations
  - Support both required and optional fields with defaults

### **5. Pipeline Builder Implementation:**

- **Specification-Driven Validation**: Builders should:
  - Validate against registered step specifications
  - Check node type constraints automatically
  - Verify dependency compatibility using semantic matching

- **Lazy Property Resolution**: Use `PropertyReference` objects that:
  - Resolve at runtime to actual SageMaker properties
  - Maintain type safety during pipeline construction
  - Enable flexible pipeline composition

- **Defensive Input/Output Handling**:
  - Validate all required dependencies are satisfied
  - Check output specifications match actual step outputs
  - Provide meaningful error messages for mismatches

### **6. Enhanced Dependency Resolution:**

- **Automatic Compatibility Scoring**: The system should:
  - Score compatibility between outputs and dependencies
  - Consider semantic keywords and step type compatibility
  - Rank potential matches for intelligent suggestions

- **Explicit Override Capability**: While supporting automatic matching:
  - Allow explicit dependency specification when needed
  - Provide clear mechanisms to override automatic resolution
  - Maintain audit trail of manual overrides

### **7. Testing & Validation Standards:**

- **Specification Testing**: Each step specification must have:
  - Unit tests for node type constraint validation
  - Compatibility tests with related specifications
  - Mock-based testing for isolation

- **Integration Testing**: Pipeline builders must validate:
  - End-to-end dependency resolution
  - Proper property path resolution
  - Node type constraint enforcement

### **8. Backward Compatibility & Migration:**

- **Legacy Support**: Maintain compatibility with existing:
  - `input_names` and `output_names` dictionaries
  - Manual dependency specification patterns
  - Existing configuration structures

- **Migration Path**: Provide clear upgrade path:
  - Automated specification generation from existing configurations
  - Validation tools to identify specification gaps
  - Gradual migration support

### **Key Evolution Points:**

1. **From Manual to Automatic**: Dependency resolution moves from manual mapping to intelligent, specification-driven matching
2. **From Implicit to Explicit**: Node types make pipeline topology explicit and enforceable
3. **From Runtime to Design-Time**: Validation moves earlier in the development cycle
4. **From Rigid to Flexible**: Multiple aliases and semantic matching provide flexibility while maintaining structure

This enhanced pattern provides the foundation for building robust, maintainable, and self-validating pipeline architectures.
