## Previous Analysis

- [[Step Builder Methods Analysis and Grouping]]

The four main groups I identified were:

1. **Core Initialization and Configuration Methods**
2. **Step Creation and Pipeline Integration Methods**
3. **Input/Output Management Methods**
4. **Dependency Management Methods**


## Pain Points Summary in Four Groups

- [[Step Builder Methods Group Pain Points]]

Based on an analysis of the topics discussed in our conversations, here is an approximate percentage breakdown of the dialogue associated with each of the four method groups.

This calculation is based on the number of distinct, significant problems and their solutions that we addressed in each category, which serves as a proxy for the volume and focus of our conversation.


### **Breakdown of Conversation Focus by Method Group**

- **Group 1: Core Initialization and Configuration Methods: `33%`**
    
    - This was the largest area of focus. A significant portion of our dialogue was dedicated to resolving issues with the initial setup and validation of the builders. This included problems like standardizing configuration loading/saving, making configuration fields optional, fixing incorrect config type mapping, and removing redundant validation logic.
        
- **Group 4: Dependency Management Methods: `27%`**
    
    - This was the second most significant area. We spent considerable time on the complex problems of how steps find and use the outputs of their predecessors. This included creating the **Property Path Registry** to resolve runtime dependencies, handling special output types like `PropertiesList`, and ensuring the correct outputs were matched from different types of steps (e.g., `LambdaStep`).
        
- **Group 3: Input/Output Management Methods: `20%`**
    
    - This category captured a substantial part of our conversation, focusing on the "data contract" between steps. Key discussions involved creating the **"Standard Pattern"** for naming conventions, normalizing S3 URI paths to prevent errors, and resolving ambiguities in how a step's inputs should be structured.
        
- **Group 2: Step Creation and Pipeline Integration Methods: `20%`**
    
    - This group also represented a significant portion of our work, focused on issues that arose during the actual creation of the SageMaker step. This included adding a safe-logging mechanism to handle pipeline variables, ensuring required arguments like `ContainerArguments` were never empty, and explicitly creating the necessary input channels for training jobs.
