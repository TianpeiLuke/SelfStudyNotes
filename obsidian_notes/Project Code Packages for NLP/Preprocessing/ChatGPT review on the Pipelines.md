## ChatGPT Review

### üîç Review of `Pipeline` Class (`pipeline.py`)

#### ‚úÖ Strengths:

- Follows the `sklearn`-style pattern with `.fit_transform()` and `transform()` methods.
    
- Modular definition of stages enables composability.
    

#### üõ† Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Consistent Interface**  
    Ensure each stage in `Pipeline` conforms to a common interface (e.g., supports both `fit()` and `transform()`).
    
2. **Partial Pipeline Execution + Resume**  
    Helpful for debugging or recovering from interruption:
    
```python
pipeline.execute_stage(stage_name, input_data)
```

    
3. **Automatic Logging & Metrics**  
    Wrap each stage with decorators to capture timing, errors, and data statistics.
    
4. **YAML/JSON Pipeline Configuration**  
    Make pipelines configurable from outside code, allowing dynamic customization:

```python
pipeline:
  - type: LowercaseProcessor
  - type: StripHTMLProcessor
  - type: Tokenizer
```
