# Background

Traditionally, Buyer Abuse (BAP) ML team relies heavily on the human-crafted features that focus on a customer’s abusive behavior over a long period in order to identify abusers. On the other hand, the voice of customers has been hidden under customer contacts in multiple channels, including Customer Service Contacts (CSC), Buyer Seller Messaging (BSM) etc. Lack of understanding of voice of customer results in a bias toward customer’s past transaction history in buyer abuse evaluation, leading to increased false positives/false negatives, and frustrations in customer experience on Amazon platform.   
  
In order to enrich our understanding of customer and to expand the coverage of buyer abuse evaluations, we initiated several projects that link the patterns of customer contacts towards existing buyer abuse MOs (Modus Operandi).
