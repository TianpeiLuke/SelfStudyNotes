It is critical to realize that ***effectiveness*** is not simply ***efficiency***. The latter is about how we handle our work, but the former is about both *what to*, *why to* and *how to* handle our life. Effectiveness is a higher level of efficiency since it is beyond one single thing but *an entire process*. 

Effectiveness is not about one single objectives. It is about *reaching **the balance of multiple objectives** in our life*.
