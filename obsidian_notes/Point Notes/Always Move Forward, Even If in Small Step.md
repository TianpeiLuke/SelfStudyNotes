The simple lesson from _The Tortoise and the Hare_ is that ***"Small steps forward continually without backward will achieve great success in long run."*** . This applies to habit development  [[Atomic Habits Book Summary]] as well as fast reading [[Speed Reading Book Summary]], effective thinking and innovations. [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 4]]

In order to fully utilize the impact of ***compound effect***, we need to make sure **we make constant improvement** at each step. In math, it coincide with _the convergence of series_. If each term in an infinite series is growing slower than the linear sum/even reducing, the compound effect may not exist and the corresponding series could be convergent. Thus it is critical to make sure no backward moving is allowed.
