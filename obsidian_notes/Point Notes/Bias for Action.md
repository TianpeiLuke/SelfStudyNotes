**Bias for Action** is a critical leadership principle from Amazon.com. It states that we need to make quick decisions *when the decision is **reversible***. Being reversible means that the impact of the decision is limited and the corresponding actions can be reversed. In other word, we can accept the mistakes and failure.

In such environment, it is even recommended to test it out with **the best possible solution at hand with as little effort as possible** without worrying too much about the cost of the failure.

Bias for action can be interpreted from the perspective of **fail to succeed**. It is not failure that matters. It is what we react to failure that matters. In this case, we need to make effective mistakes to guide us the next step.

Bias for action is the opposite with calibrated decision making. We need to maintain a balance between *careful planning* and *bias for action*. Therefore, it is always important to estimate if such decision is reversible. For irreversible decision, it is worthy of the time we take to prepare before we make decisions. Ask questions before start working.  For reversible one, we build a test case and prioritize the actions.  [[Leadership Principle Bias for Action]]

From [[Atomic Habits Book Summary]], we can see a similar statement: it is not the motivation that initiates the behavior change, it is the action that triggers it.

Bias for action can be seen in progressive innovations. Even if the step is small, it still worth taking actions before [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 4]]
