- *Most people **listen with intent to reply**. But we should really **listen with intent to understand***. We are too ready to judge the others and eager to express our opinion without fully understand other's perspective. This hurt our relationship with others. If you fail to understand others, you fail to ***earn their trusts***, thus fail to ***influence*** them.
  
- Most of us listen others while thinking about ourselves. The *autobiographical responses* includes *evaluate; probe; advise; interpret.*

- ***Empathetic listening*** requires strong ***intrinsic security*** and ***integrity*** in one's character to implement. _To influence others, we need to first allow us to be influenced_.
  
- Empathetic listening is not only a communication skill but should also come from our own desire to understand. We need to ***hold genuine interest towards others***.
