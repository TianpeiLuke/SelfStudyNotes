A **project** has a clear definition and scope:
- The **goal** of project: what **concrete objective** to achieve in the end and **why**.
- The **outcome** of project: what to deliver in the end, including **the final form** of the outcome (product, service, publications etc.) and the metric to **measure the success**.
- The **deadline** of project: when to deliver the final outcome. **Every project need to end some day.**  
- The **resource** of project: money, space, time, human, skills, software, hardware, organization, relationship etc.
- The **plan** and **progress tracker**: define and track each steps of implementation. Plan should be flexible and should be made *in backwards from the deadline*. 

**Project management** is a bottom-up approach, since each project is concrete and well-defined.  On the other hand, an **area of responsibility** has no clear definition since it is long term and requires continual maintenance. An area of responsibility cannot be "delivered" thus cannot be measured as "success" or not either. It corresponds to a role in our life. Management of area need to **personal vision** and **personal leadership**. It should be defined from **top-down**. Check top-down productivity management in [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Book Summary]].

An **area of responsibility**: 
- The **vision** or **mission** of area: what **the long term objectives** to achieve.  
- The **role**: what is my role corresponds to this area? what is the qualification and expectation on this role? What are the roles for others who share this area with me?
- The **principle and standard** of area: what **standard, principles and centers** to uphold in that area. Use a **mission statement** to document the roles, missions and their associated standards and principles. [^1]
- The **scope** of area: issues that fall under my responsibility and influence, fitting the expectation of my role. It is important to define the scope of area according to the degree of our influence and control. Focus on the **circle of influence** instead of the **circle of concern**. [^2] 
- The **resource** of area: These are resources managed by our role. Resources are attached to our responsibility. The higher the responsibility, the more resources that are allocated under us. 
- The **workflow** or **process** of area: to fulfill the responsibility, we need to establish workflows and processes to make incremental progress towards the vision.  This includes *development of habits* that handle routine daily activities. [^3] Finally, we need to **review** and **renew** the area regularly. [^4]

In BASB, an area folder would include all information that are related to the area. An area can be associated with job, home, computer, location etc. It can also be any topics that are actively pursued. For instance, "health" can be an area and thus include all information related to heath. An area can be associated with a low-level routine process without deadline.
