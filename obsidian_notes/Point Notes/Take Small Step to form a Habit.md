- We should not take too much effort to practice a habit from beginning and in the end. If you take too much effort at beginning, the habit is associated with pain and it is less likely to last for a long time.
  
- To form a habit, begin with a little every day/regularly. Do not overdo it and do not make it exhausted. 
  
- What we need to do is to capture the cue and take action. 

Thoughts:
- To have a habit of thinking: taking 1-3 notes per day and reflect on the notes. Thinking a bit every day.
