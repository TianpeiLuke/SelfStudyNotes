***Win/Loss*** and its *competitive mindset* are critical for sports, games, society and economy. It is through competitions that limited resources are distributed. Competitions and its associated Win/Loss push the new development in personal, social and economical status. 

***Win/Win*** is an *cooperative mindset*. It is recommended if the goal of both parties are not in conflict and there are abundant resources for both to achieve their goals.

The important point is to understand ***the interests of both parties to decide which mindset to apply***. When both parties have interests to collaborate and to reach agreement, it is when *Win/Win mentality* start to shrine. On the other hand, it is always up to us to decide if we want to participate in competition. ***No Deal*** is also an option when there is no viable Win/Win solution between two parties and we are not pursing a competition.
