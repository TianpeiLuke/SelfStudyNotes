- Our habits are triggered by cues and cues are associated with the environment. Thus by changing environment, our established habits are easier to alter and harder to maintain. [[Atomic Habits Excerpt 05 Environment Design]]
  
- Since our habits form the basis of our identity and our habits are easily established with a given environment, our identity is thus formed under a certain environment. 
  
- Reversely, our identity is determined by our environment __indirectly__. It is **the habit-triggering cues** in environment that helps to form our identity and life style.
  
- There is way to mitigate the impact of environment on our identity. In this situation, we need to capture the cues that trigger our habit and to design/influence our surroundings to develop such cues. 

 Thoughts:
- Moving to new city, new country put a challenge to our established habit. It is significantly harder to maintain a good habit under new environment. 
- In order to keep our old good habit when we moved, we need to search for similar cues as the old environment. 
- To form a new habit, we need to consider the cues and how we interact with environment
- We need to **design environment** to _make cues obvious_
- During the design of environment (living house, surrounding neighborhood), one should consider what cues of habits are obvious and easy to access. 
- This is also why family with kids tends to move to good school district. Good schools tends to have plenty cues (library, teachers, furniture, safety, friends) that triggers learning, reading and healthy relationship development.
