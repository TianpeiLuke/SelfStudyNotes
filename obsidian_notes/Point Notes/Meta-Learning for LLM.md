# Meta-Learning for BERT-style Models and Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing: A Survey

## 1. Introduction

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone a significant transformation with the advent and rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs).1 Foundational models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 7, built upon the Transformer architecture 1, represent a paradigm shift. These models are pre-trained on vast corpora of text using self-supervised learning objectives, most notably Masked Language Modeling (MLM), where the model learns to predict masked tokens based on their bidirectional context.7 This pre-training imbues LLMs with remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation, enabling strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks.3

Despite their power, a primary challenge lies in adapting these massive models to specific downstream tasks or domains. While standard fine-tuning is effective, it often requires substantial amounts of labeled data for the target task.3 This presents a significant bottleneck in scenarios characterized by data scarcity, such as low-resource languages, specialized domains (e.g., finance, medicine), or tasks where annotation is inherently expensive or time-consuming.16 This limitation hinders the broad applicability of LLMs and motivates the exploration of more data-efficient adaptation techniques.

Meta-learning, often referred to as "learning to learn," emerges as a compelling paradigm to address this data scarcity challenge.16 The core idea is to train a model not just to perform a single task, but to learn _how_ to learn new tasks quickly and efficiently from limited data.16 By exposing the model to a diverse range of learning tasks during a "meta-training" phase, meta-learning aims to instill adaptation capabilities, thereby enhancing data efficiency and generalization to novel situations.17

This report provides a comprehensive survey of meta-learning techniques as applied to BERT-style models and contemporary LLMs within the NLP domain. It aims to:

1. Define meta-learning specifically within the context of NLP and LLMs.
2. Detail common meta-learning algorithms (e.g., MAML, Reptile, Prototypical Networks) adapted for these models.
3. Explore their application in various few-shot downstream NLP tasks.
4. Analyze the interactions between meta-learning methods and the standard LLM training phases (pre-training, fine-tuning).
5. Discuss the reported benefits, including sample efficiency and generalization.
6. Identify the challenges and limitations associated with applying meta-learning to large-scale models.
7. Reference existing survey literature in this area.
8. Synthesize these findings to provide a comparative overview, highlight current research trends, and identify open questions for future investigation.

The subsequent sections will delve into each of these objectives, providing a structured overview of the current state and future potential of meta-learning for adapting large language models in NLP.

## 2. Defining Meta-Learning in the NLP/LLM Context

### 2.1 Core Concepts and Terminology

At its core, meta-learning shifts the focus from learning a specific task function, fθ​(x), parameterized by θ, to learning the _learning algorithm_ itself.17 This learning algorithm can be conceptualized as a function, Fϕ​(.), parameterized by meta-parameters ϕ. The input to Fϕ​(.) is the training data for a specific task, and its output is the set of optimized task-specific parameters, θ∗.17 The objective of meta-learning is to learn the meta-parameters ϕ by training across a distribution of different tasks (the meta-training set, Ttrain​) such that the resulting learning algorithm Fϕ​(.) performs effectively—typically meaning it adapts quickly and generalizes well—when presented with new, previously unseen tasks drawn from a similar distribution (the meta-testing set, Ttest​).23

Several key terms are central to the meta-learning framework:

- **Meta-training:** The process of learning the meta-parameters ϕ by optimizing performance across a collection of training tasks.
- **Meta-testing:** The evaluation phase where the learned algorithm Fϕ​(.) is applied to new, unseen tasks to assess its adaptation and generalization capabilities.
- **Task:** A single learning problem within the meta-learning setup (e.g., classifying sentiment for a specific product domain, performing NER for a new entity type). Each task typically consists of a support set and a query set.
- **Support Set (Sn​):** A small set of labeled examples provided for a specific task n. The learning algorithm uses the support set to adapt to the task.17
- **Query Set (Qn​):** A set of examples used to evaluate the performance of the model after it has adapted using the support set Sn​.17 The loss on the query set often drives the update of the meta-parameters ϕ during meta-training.
- **N-way K-shot Learning:** A common experimental setup in few-shot learning and meta-learning, particularly for classification. Each task involves distinguishing between N classes, with K labeled examples (shots) provided for each class in the support set.21

### 2.2 Distinguishing Meta-Learning from Related Paradigms

While related to other learning paradigms that leverage prior knowledge or multiple tasks, meta-learning possesses distinct characteristics:

- **Transfer Learning:** Transfer learning typically involves pre-training a model on a large, general dataset and then fine-tuning it on a specific target task.3 While meta-learning also leverages prior experience (from meta-training tasks), its explicit goal is to optimize the _process of adaptation_ itself, often by simulating the few-shot learning scenario during meta-training.17 The pre-training objective in standard transfer learning usually does not explicitly target few-shot adaptation capability.23 Fine-tuning, a common transfer learning technique, adapts the entire model or parts of it using target task data, whereas meta-learning might learn an initialization, a metric space, or an optimization strategy designed for rapid adaptation with minimal data.17
    
- **Multi-task Learning (MTL):** MTL involves training a single model on multiple related tasks simultaneously, typically aiming to improve performance on all tasks by leveraging shared representations.23 While meta-training also involves multiple tasks, its primary objective is not necessarily to achieve optimal performance on the training tasks themselves, but rather to learn _how to learn_ new, unseen tasks quickly and effectively.17 Some meta-learning frameworks might resemble MTL setups but are specifically structured to optimize for few-shot adaptation on future tasks.25
    
- **In-Context Learning (ICL):** ICL is a remarkable emergent capability observed primarily in very large language models.3 It allows the model to perform a new task by conditioning on a prompt that includes a few demonstrations (input-output examples) of the task, without any updates to the model's parameters.8 Meta-learning, in its traditional forms (optimization-based, metric-based), involves an explicit meta-training phase to learn an adaptation strategy (e.g., a good initialization, a metric space) that is then applied during meta-testing, often involving computations based on the support set.17 Adaptation in ICL happens implicitly within the forward pass based on the prompt context.
    

However, the boundary between meta-learning and ICL is becoming increasingly blurred. While ICL is often viewed as an emergent phenomenon requiring no specific meta-training 30, recent research trends challenge this simple view. The performance of ICL can be inconsistent, particularly for complex tasks like few-shot Relation Extraction (RE), where success heavily depends on the quality and selection of demonstrations in the prompt.25 This has led to the development of approaches explicitly termed "Meta In-Context Learning" (Meta-ICL) or "In-Context Tuning" (ICT).25 These methods employ meta-learning principles _during a training phase_ to enhance the model's inherent ICL capabilities. For example, a model might be trained across diverse tasks using an objective that directly mimics the ICL setup (predicting the output for a query given demonstrations in the context).25 This explicit training teaches the model to leverage in-context examples more effectively. This suggests that the emergent ICL seen in LLMs might be a form of implicit meta-learning acquired during massive pre-training 37, and explicit meta-training acts as a refinement process to bolster this ability, making it more robust and performant, especially for challenging few-shot tasks. This points towards a future where pre-training objectives might incorporate meta-learning principles to directly cultivate stronger ICL.36

### 2.3 Goals of Meta-Learning in NLP

The application of meta-learning to NLP, particularly with LLMs, is driven by several key objectives:

- **Data Efficiency:** The foremost goal is to overcome the reliance on large labeled datasets for adapting models to new tasks or domains.16 This is especially critical for low-resource languages where labeled data is scarce, or in specialized domains like chemistry or finance where annotation requires expert knowledge and is costly.17 Meta-learning aims to enable effective learning from only a handful of examples (few-shot learning).17
- **Fast Adaptation:** Meta-learning seeks to enable models to be rapidly deployed or adapted to new tasks, changing requirements, or evolving data distributions using minimal task-specific examples and computation.17 This reduces the turnaround time for developing solutions for new NLP problems.
- **Improved Generalization:** By learning from a diverse set of tasks during meta-training, meta-learning aims to discover more robust and generalizable learning strategies or representations that transfer effectively across different tasks, domains, or even languages.16 This contrasts with standard supervised learning on a single task, which might lead to overfitting and poor generalization.

Furthermore, meta-learning is increasingly viewed not just as a technique for handling few-shot scenarios, but as a fundamental approach to enhance the overall _transferability and adaptability_ of large foundation models.38 As LLMs become more central, methods are needed to efficiently steer their capabilities towards specific downstream needs. Concepts like "meta-tuning" 38 position meta-learning as a distinct stage after pre-training, specifically designed to prepare the model for efficient downstream adaptation. This reframing suggests meta-learning could become a core component in the LLM lifecycle, offering a potentially more principled and generalizable alternative or complement to standard fine-tuning, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where naive fine-tuning might struggle.39

## 3. Core Meta-Learning Algorithms for LLMs

A variety of meta-learning algorithms have been developed, primarily in the computer vision domain, and subsequently adapted or proposed for use with LLMs in NLP. These can be broadly categorized into optimization-based, metric-based, and model-based approaches.18

### 3.1 Optimization-Based Methods

These methods focus on learning aspects of the optimization process itself, such as model initializations or update rules, to enable rapid adaptation via gradient descent on the support set of a new task.

- **MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning):** MAML aims to find a set of initial model parameters θ that are highly sensitive to task-specific updates, such that only a few steps of gradient descent using a new task's support set yield good performance on that task's query set.17 The meta-training process involves a bi-level optimization loop: an inner loop adapts the parameters θ to a specific task using its support set, and an outer loop updates the initial θ based on the performance of the adapted parameters on the query set.30 The full MAML algorithm requires computing gradients through the inner optimization steps, often involving second-order derivatives, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially for large models.17 Consequently, a common simplification is **First-Order MAML (FOMAML)**, which ignores these second-order terms, making computation significantly cheaper.28 MAML and FOMAML have been applied in NLP for tasks like text classification 28, NER 21, and often utilize BERT or other PLMs as the base model.44 Key challenges remain its computational cost (even for FOMAML with large models) and potential training instability.17
    
- **Reptile:** Proposed as a simpler, first-order alternative to MAML, Reptile also aims to find a good parameter initialization for fast adaptation.17 Its mechanism is straightforward: for each meta-training iteration, it samples a task, performs multiple (k) steps of standard SGD (or Adam) on that task starting from the current initialization ϕ, obtaining adapted parameters ϕk​. It then updates the initialization by moving it slightly towards the adapted parameters: ϕ←ϕ+ϵ(ϕk​−ϕ), where ϵ is the meta-learning rate.32 Reptile avoids the explicit bi-level structure and the need to differentiate through the optimization process, making it computationally less demanding than MAML.32 It has been successfully applied to few-shot NER using BERT embeddings.28 Theoretical and empirical analyses suggest Reptile might require more data points per task (m) to achieve performance comparable to MAML in some settings, potentially due to its update rule being more sensitive to within-task sample complexity.46 Variants like **Eigen-Reptile** have been proposed to improve robustness, particularly against sampling and label noise, by updating meta-parameters along the principal direction of historical task-specific parameters.45
    
- **Other Optimization-Based Approaches:** Beyond learning initializations, meta-learning can target other aspects of optimization. Some methods learn task-specific or dynamic learning rates or complete update rules.18 Specific algorithms like **LEOPARD** 28 and **AMGS** 44 were developed for few-shot text classification, often building upon MAML/Reptile principles and incorporating PLMs like BERT. **MetaPrompting** adapts optimization-based meta-learning (like MAML or Reptile) specifically to learn better initializations for soft prompts used with PLMs.41
    

### 3.2 Metric-Based Methods (Learning to Compare)

Metric-based methods learn an embedding space where similarity between data points corresponds to class membership. Classification of new examples (from the query set) is performed by comparing their embeddings to those of the support set examples, typically without requiring gradient updates at meta-test time.

- **Prototypical Networks (ProtoNets):** ProtoNets learn an embedding function ϕ such that examples from the same class cluster together.17 For a given task in the N-way K-shot setting, a single prototype vector ck​ is computed for each class k by averaging the embeddings of its K support examples: ck​=K1​∑(xi​,yi​)∈Sk​​ϕ(xi​). A query example xq​ is then classified by finding the class prototype closest to its embedding ϕ(xq​), typically using Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, often followed by a softmax function to produce probabilities.28 ProtoNets have been applied to few-shot NLP tasks like NER 28 (often requiring adaptations like word-level comparisons and potentially integrating a CRF 28) and relation classification 28, usually leveraging BERT embeddings. They are generally simpler and faster at test time than optimization-based methods but can struggle if the class mean is not a good representative (e.g., for multi-modal class distributions) or can overfit in text classification scenarios.33
    
- **Matching Networks:** Instead of computing class prototypes, Matching Networks compare a query example's embedding directly to each support example's embedding using an attention mechanism or a kernel function to compute a weighted sum of support set labels.23
    
- **Relation Networks:** These methods employ a separate neural network module (the relation module) that learns to predict a similarity score between the embedding of a query example and the embedding(s) of support examples.29
    

### 3.3 Model-Based Methods

Model-based meta-learning approaches typically utilize a meta-learner model (often a recurrent neural network like an LSTM) that processes the support set examples sequentially and updates its internal state or directly predicts the parameters of the task-specific model.28 This internal state is designed to encode task-specific information, allowing for rapid prediction on query examples. While conceptually powerful, these methods have been less commonly explored for large-scale LLMs in NLP, potentially due to the added complexity of training the meta-learner itself alongside the base LLM.

### 3.4 Comparative Analysis

The choice between these algorithm families involves trade-offs in computational complexity, adaptation mechanism, performance characteristics, and suitability for different tasks. Table 1 provides a comparative summary.

**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Meta-Learning Algorithms for LLMs**

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**MAML / FOMAML**|**Reptile**|**Prototypical Networks**|**Meta-ICL / ICT**|
|**Core Mechanism**|Learn sensitive initialization|Learn initialization close to task optima|Learn metric/embedding space|Train model to perform ICL effectively|
|**Adaptation Method**|Few gradient steps on support set|Few gradient steps on support set|Compute prototypes & distances|Process prompt with examples (frozen params)|
|**Computational Cost (Meta-Training)**|High (MAML: 2nd order) / Moderate (FOMAML)|Moderate (1st order, multiple inner steps)|Moderate (embedding + loss)|Moderate/High (depends on base LLM size)|
|**Computational Cost (Meta-Testing)**|Moderate (few gradient steps)|Moderate (few gradient steps)|Low (embedding + distance calc)|Low (single forward pass)|
|**Order**|2nd (MAML) / 1st (FOMAML)|1st|N/A (Metric-based)|N/A (Trained ICL)|
|**Key NLP Apps**|Text Class. 28, NER 21, Event Det. 42|NER 28, Text Class. 44|NER 28, Rel. Class. 28, Text Class. 33|Rel. Ext. 25, Text Class. 30, Gen. Few-Shot 30|
|**Strengths**|Model-agnostic, potentially high performance|Simpler than MAML, 1st order|Simple, fast inference, good baseline|Leverages LLM ICL, no test-time grads, efficient inference|
|**Weaknesses**|Costly, stability issues 17|May need more data/task 46, noise sensitive 45|Assumes clusterable embeddings, can overfit 33|Requires large base LLM, ICL limitations 25|

A notable pattern emerges regarding the trade-off between algorithmic complexity and practical application in NLP with LLMs. While MAML offers a theoretically appealing, model-agnostic framework, its computational expense, especially the second-order version, appears prohibitive or offers diminishing returns when dealing with models containing billions of parameters.17 Consequently, simpler first-order methods like FOMAML 28 and Reptile 32, along with metric-based methods like Prototypical Networks 17, are frequently employed or adapted in NLP studies.28 However, this simplicity might come with its own set of challenges. Reptile, for instance, might exhibit lower data efficiency than MAML in certain low-data-per-task regimes 46 and require modifications like Eigen-Reptile to handle noise effectively.45 Similarly, Prototypical Networks can suffer from overfitting 33 and rely on the assumption that class means provide good representations. This suggests that while simpler algorithms are attractive for scalability, careful adaptation and potentially hybrid approaches (like Proto-Reptile, which combines Reptile's embedding learning with Prototypical Networks' classification 28) are often necessary to achieve robust performance with LLMs.

Furthermore, the nature of the NLP task itself seems to influence the choice and adaptation of meta-learning algorithms. Prototypical Networks, naturally suited for classification 28, require non-trivial modifications for structured prediction tasks like NER, such as incorporating word-level comparisons and potentially a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer to model sequence dependencies.28 Optimization-based methods like MAML and Reptile, being "model-agnostic" 21, offer theoretical flexibility for various task structures, although their practical implementation still needs task-specific considerations. This task-dependent nature suggests that there is no single universally optimal meta-learning algorithm for all NLP problems; the choice necessitates careful consideration of the task's characteristics and the algorithm's inherent strengths and weaknesses.

## 4. Applications in Downstream NLP Tasks (Few-Shot Focus)

Meta-learning finds its most prominent application in NLP within the few-shot learning paradigm, aiming to adapt LLMs to various tasks using only a small number of labeled examples.

### 4.1 Few-Shot Text Classification

This is arguably the most common benchmark for meta-learning in NLP.27 The goal is to classify text documents into novel categories given only K examples per category.

- **Algorithms Employed:** Various algorithms have been explored, including optimization-based methods like MAML/FOMAML 28, Reptile 44, and specialized variants like LEOPARD 28 and AMGS.44 Metric-based methods like Prototypical Networks are also common.33 Prompt-based meta-learning approaches, such as MetaPrompting 41 and LM-BFF 14, leverage the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs more directly.
- **Key Findings:** Meta-learning approaches consistently demonstrate superior performance compared to standard fine-tuning, especially in very low-shot settings (e.g., 1-shot or 5-shot).14 Combining meta-learning with strong pre-trained models like BERT is standard practice.33 Prompt-based methods show particular promise by framing the task in a way that aligns well with the LLM's pre-training objectives.14 However, challenges like overfitting, particularly for simpler methods like Prototypical Networks, persist 33, motivating techniques like LaSAML (using label semantics) 44 or LAQDA (using label adapters and query augmentation).33

### 4.2 Few-Shot Question Answering (QA)

Adapting QA systems to new domains (e.g., medical, legal) or novel question formats with limited examples is another relevant application area. While less extensively documented in the provided snippets compared to classification or NER/RE, meta-learning can potentially optimize models to quickly grasp new context types, answer structures, or reasoning patterns required for specific QA tasks. One relevant study, CaMeLS, uses meta-learning not for initial few-shot adaptation but to improve the _online_ adaptation of a QA model as it processes a continuous stream of documents, learning to weight informative tokens during fine-tuning.48

### 4.3 Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition (NER)

NER involves identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., Person, Location, Organization) in text. Few-shot NER focuses on recognizing entity types not seen during initial training, using only K examples per new type.

- **Algorithms Employed:** Metric-based methods like Prototypical Networks, often combined with a CRF layer for sequence modeling, have shown success.28 Optimization-based methods like Reptile 28 and MAML 21 have also been investigated. Hybrid approaches like Proto-Reptile combine Reptile for embedding learning and ProtoNets for classification.28 MetaIE aims to build a general meta-model for various Information Extraction (IE) tasks, including NER.49
- **Key Findings:** Meta-learning approaches generally outperform standard BERT fine-tuning baselines in few-shot NER settings.28 A crucial aspect is the **task generation scheme**—how standard NER datasets are converted into a series of N-way K-shot tasks suitable for meta-training.28 The diversity of tasks during meta-training appears beneficial.28 Integrating sequence modeling components like CRF can significantly boost performance for metric-based methods on this structured prediction task.28

### 4.4 Few-Shot Relation Extraction (RE)

RE aims to identify semantic relationships between pairs of entities in text (e.g., `LocatedIn(Paris, France)`). Few-shot RE tackles the challenge of identifying new relation types given limited examples.

- **Algorithms Employed:** Prototypical Networks have been applied to few-shot relation classification.28 More recently, Meta-In-Context Learning (Meta-ICL) approaches like MICRE have emerged, specifically designed to leverage and improve the ICL capabilities of LLMs for RE.25 MetaIE also includes RE in its scope.49
- **Key Findings:** Standard ICL in LLMs has shown limitations in effectively handling few-shot RE tasks.25 Meta-ICL frameworks like MICRE address this by meta-training an LLM on a diverse collection of RE datasets using an ICL objective. This explicitly teaches the model _how_ to perform ICL for RE, leading to significantly improved zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen RE tasks without requiring parameter updates at inference.25 Techniques like tabular prompting help create a unified format for different RE subtasks and few-shot examples during meta-training and inference.25

### 4.5 Other Applications

The principles of meta-learning extend beyond these core tasks, finding application in:

- **Event Detection:** MetaEvent uses meta-learning for zero- and few-shot event detection, combining prompt tuning and contrastive learning.42
- **Dialogue Systems:** Improving dialogue state tracking in new domains 18 or few-shot dialogue completion.38
- **Machine Translation:** Adapting translation models to low-resource languages or new domains.17
- **Sentiment Analysis & Intent Classification:** Few-shot adaptation for these classification tasks.28
- **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL):** Included within the scope of general IE meta-models like MetaIE.49
- **Broader ML Areas:** Meta-learning concepts are also applied to improve knowledge distillation, enable continual/lifelong learning by mitigating catastrophic forgetting, and facilitate online adaptation of models to streaming data.17

Observing these applications reveals that the effectiveness and specific implementation details of meta-learning are often task-dependent within NLP. While the core principles are shared, successful application frequently requires tailoring. For instance, the need to integrate a CRF for NER when using Prototypical Networks highlights how structured prediction tasks demand different considerations than simple classification.28 Similarly, the observed struggles of standard ICL on few-shot RE necessitated the development of specialized Meta-ICL approaches like MICRE, demonstrating that task-specific bottlenecks exist.25 This heterogeneity suggests that "meta-learning for NLP" is not a monolithic solution; rather, it's a versatile framework whose optimal instantiation depends heavily on the target task's characteristics.

Concurrently, there is a noticeable trend towards developing more unified meta-learning frameworks. Instead of focusing solely on one task type (like classification or NER), newer research aims to build single "meta-models" capable of handling a broader range of related tasks. MetaIE, for example, explicitly targets building a single small LM meta-model adaptable to various Information Extraction tasks (NER, RE, EE, SRL) by learning a shared "meta-understanding" of IE.49 Similarly, MICRE learns from a diverse collection of RE datasets to generalize better to _any_ new RE task.25 This ambition aligns with the concept of meta-tuning large foundation models 38 to enhance their general adaptability. This reflects a move beyond solving isolated few-shot problems towards building models with broader, inherent adaptability across related NLP functionalities, cultivated through meta-training over diverse task distributions.

## 5. Interaction with LLM Training Paradigms

Meta-learning does not operate in isolation but interacts significantly with the established training paradigms of LLMs, namely pre-training and fine-tuning, as well as the emergent capability of in-context learning.

### 5.1 Leveraging Pre-training

The success of meta-learning in modern NLP is inextricably linked to the use of powerful pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT and its successors.14 The rich semantic and syntactic representations learned during large-scale pre-training, often via objectives like Masked Language Modeling (MLM) 7, provide a strong inductive bias and a robust foundation upon which meta-learning algorithms can build. Few-shot adaptation would be significantly harder, if not impossible, without leveraging these pre-trained features.

Some meta-learning approaches actively try to align their adaptation mechanism with the model's pre-training. Prompt-based meta-learning methods, for instance, often formulate the downstream task as a cloze-style (fill-in-the-blank) question, directly mimicking the MLM objective [14, Fig 1(c)]. MetaEvent uses templates like "A \<mask\> event" 42, and LM-BFF employs similar prompt-based fine-tuning.14 This alignment potentially allows the model to better leverage the knowledge implicitly encoded during its pre-training phase for the downstream task.

### 5.2 Meta-Learning during or after Pre-training

Meta-learning is increasingly being integrated into the LLM training lifecycle beyond just being applied as a final adaptation step.

- **Continual Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP-training):** This involves applying meta-learning principles to continually adapt a pre-trained LM using sequences of unlabeled corpora from different domains.51 The goal is to adapt the LM to new domains incrementally without forgetting knowledge from previous domains or the general pre-training (catastrophic forgetting mitigation) and potentially encouraging positive knowledge transfer between domains.51 This effectively integrates meta-learning concepts into the later stages of the pre-training/adaptation process.
- **Meta-Tuning:** This proposes a distinct meta-learning stage situated _between_ initial large-scale pre-training and final downstream task fine-tuning.38 The model is meta-trained on a diverse set of tasks during this stage to explicitly enhance its general adaptability and few-shot learning capabilities before being deployed or further fine-tuned.39 The PMF pipeline exemplifies this: Pre-training → Meta-training → Fine-tuning.39
- **Self-Supervised Meta-Learning:** When labeled data for meta-training tasks is scarce, tasks can be synthetically created from unlabeled text data.22 Objectives like Mask Token Prediction (MTP) can be used within the meta-learning framework (e.g., during the inner loop) to improve generalization and combat overfitting on the limited supervised meta-training examples.22

### 5.3 Meta-Learning vs./for Fine-tuning

The relationship between meta-learning and standard fine-tuning is multifaceted.

- **Improving Initialization:** Optimization-based methods like MAML and Reptile are often framed as learning a superior _initialization_ for subsequent fine-tuning.17 The meta-learned parameters are expected to be closer to optimal solutions across various tasks, allowing fine-tuning on a new task to converge faster and to a better minimum with fewer examples.
- **Baseline Comparison:** Standard fine-tuning on the few available support set examples serves as a common and important baseline against which meta-learning methods are evaluated.14 Meta-learning approaches aim to significantly outperform this baseline, especially in very low-data regimes.
- **Guiding Fine-tuning:** Meta-learning can go beyond just providing an initialization and actively _guide_ the fine-tuning process. For example, CaMeLS meta-trains an auxiliary model to predict token-level importance weights, which are then used to dynamically adjust the learning rate (by reweighting the loss) during online fine-tuning on new documents.48 Meta-learning can also be used to learn optimal hyperparameters like learning rates for fine-tuning.22
- **Complementary Approaches:** Some methods explicitly combine meta-learning principles with fine-tuning. LM-BFF, for instance, integrates prompt-based learning and demonstration incorporation within a fine-tuning framework for few-shot learning.14 Studies applying Prototypical Networks to NER found that performance significantly improved when the meta-learned model was further fine-tuned on the task-specific support set at meta-test time.28 This highlights a synergistic relationship, where meta-learning provides a strong starting point or guidance, and fine-tuning performs the final task-specific adaptation. This contrasts with pure ICL approaches that completely eschew fine-tuning.30
- **Performance Trade-offs:** For certain tasks and model sizes, the performance difference might be nuanced. One study on financial sentiment analysis found that fine-tuning smaller LLMs (250M-3B parameters) could achieve performance comparable to few-shot ICL using the much larger GPT-3.5-Turbo, and also comparable to state-of-the-art fine-tuned models.50 This suggests that for specific domains and when fine-tuning is feasible, it remains a competitive approach.

### 5.4 Meta-Learning and In-Context Learning (Meta-ICL)

As previously discussed (Section 2.2), a significant recent trend is the direct application of meta-learning principles to improve ICL.

- **Explicit Training for ICL:** Methods like Meta-ICL 25 and In-Context Tuning (ICT) 30 explicitly meta-train LLMs using an objective that mirrors the ICL process. The model learns to predict the output for a query example given a context containing task instructions and demonstrations, across a wide variety of training tasks.
- **Benefits over Standard ICL:** This explicit training aims to make the model a more reliable and effective in-context learner, overcoming limitations observed in standard ICL, particularly for tasks like few-shot RE where vanilla ICL struggles.25
- **Alternative to Bi-Level Optimization:** ICT, for example, directly fine-tunes the LM on the sequence prediction objective inherent in ICL, avoiding the complex and potentially unstable bi-level optimization characteristic of MAML.30
- **Recursive Improvement:** Research suggests that ICL itself can be recursively improved via meta-in-context learning, where presenting sequences of related learning problems within the context allows the LLM to adapt its internal priors and learning strategies.35

The evolution of meta-learning's interaction with LLM training paradigms indicates a shift from viewing it merely as a post-hoc adaptation technique towards recognizing it as a more fundamental tool integrated throughout the LLM lifecycle. Its principles are now influencing continual pre-training 51, forming dedicated "meta-tuning" stages 38, and even being used to shape and improve core LLM capabilities like ICL.25 This deepening integration suggests meta-learning is becoming instrumental not just for _using_ pre-trained models effectively, but for actively _shaping_ their adaptability and core functionalities.

Furthermore, the relationship between meta-learning and fine-tuning appears more collaborative than purely competitive. While some meta-learning approaches aim to replace test-time fine-tuning (e.g., metric-based methods, Meta-ICL), many optimization-based methods are explicitly designed to make subsequent few-shot fine-tuning more efficient and effective.17 Examples like LM-BFF 14 and the observed benefit of fine-tuning meta-learned ProtoNets 28 underscore this synergy. Meta-learning often provides the foundation or guidance, while fine-tuning performs the final specialization, particularly for smaller models where fine-tuning remains computationally feasible.

## 6. Benefits and Advantages

Applying meta-learning techniques to BERT-style models and LLMs offers several significant advantages, primarily centered around efficiency and generalization in data-constrained settings.

- **Sample Efficiency / Few-Shot Performance:** This is the most prominent benefit and the primary motivation for much of the research in this area. Meta-learning enables models to achieve strong performance on new NLP tasks even when provided with only a handful of labeled examples (K-shot learning).14 Numerous studies demonstrate that meta-learning approaches outperform standard fine-tuning baselines, often by significant margins, in low-data regimes.14 This capability is crucial for addressing data scarcity challenges in specialized domains (e.g., chemistry 21, finance 50) or for low-resource languages.17
    
- **Faster Adaptation:** Meta-learned models are designed to adapt quickly to new tasks. This "speed" manifests in different ways depending on the algorithm. Optimization-based methods like MAML and Reptile learn initializations that allow the model to converge rapidly during fine-tuning on the new task, requiring fewer gradient steps.17 Metric-based methods like Prototypical Networks, and Meta-ICL approaches, achieve fast adaptation at _inference time_ by avoiding gradient-based updates altogether; adaptation involves efficient computations like calculating embeddings and distances or simply processing the prompt.17 This inference-time efficiency is particularly valuable for applications requiring real-time responses or where per-task fine-tuning is impractical.
    
- **Enhanced Generalization:** By training across a diverse distribution of tasks, meta-learning encourages the model to learn more generalizable representations or adaptation strategies that transfer better to unseen tasks, domains, or languages compared to training on a single task.16 The diversity of the meta-training tasks plays a key role in achieving good generalization.28 Techniques like meta-tuning explicitly aim to improve generalization, particularly to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks 39, and continual DAP-training seeks cross-domain knowledge transfer.51
    
- **Potential for Automation:** Meta-learning can contribute to automating parts of the model adaptation pipeline. For example, methods have been developed for automatic prompt generation within meta-learning frameworks, reducing the need for manual prompt engineering.14 Similarly, meta-learning can be used to learn optimal optimization strategies (e.g., learning rates) 18, automating hyperparameter tuning for adaptation. Reinforcement learning, which shares conceptual links with meta-learning (learning policies for actions/updates), has also been used to automatically discover effective prompts.54
    
- **Improved Robustness:** Some meta-learning algorithms are designed with robustness in mind. Eigen-Reptile, for instance, aims to be less sensitive to sampling and label noise compared to standard Reptile.45 Meta-learning approaches can also lead to more stable fine-tuning compared to naive few-shot fine-tuning.14 MetaPrompting specifically targets the instability associated with varying prompt initializations in few-shot settings.41
    

Beyond these primary benefits, the structured nature of meta-learning might offer advantages in terms of interpretability or control compared to relying solely on the emergent, often opaque, behavior of LLMs, especially in the context of ICL.37 Prompt-based meta-learning methods 14 make the adaptation mechanism (the prompt) explicit. Methods that learn specific adaptation components, like loss re-weighting strategies 48, provide clearer insights into the adaptation process. By explicitly defining tasks, support/query sets, and optimization objectives, meta-learning frameworks may provide more levers for understanding and guiding model adaptation compared to the black-box nature of standard prompting for ICL.

## 7. Challenges and Limitations

Despite the promise and demonstrated benefits, applying meta-learning to large language models in NLP faces several significant challenges.

- **Computational Cost and Scalability:** Meta-training can be extremely computationally demanding, especially when using large LLMs.3 Algorithms like MAML, which may require computing second-order derivatives or unrolling the inner optimization loop over multiple steps, exacerbate this issue.17 Storing multiple copies of model states or gradients during meta-training consumes considerable memory. Scaling these algorithms efficiently to models with hundreds of billions of parameters remains a major hurdle, driving interest in simpler first-order methods like Reptile or FOMAML.32
    
- **Training Stability and Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Meta-learning algorithms are often sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the meta-learning rate, inner loop learning rate, number of inner loop steps, and task batch size.17 Finding the right combination often requires extensive tuning. The nested optimization structure of methods like MAML can also lead to training instabilities.30 Performance can vary significantly depending on random initialization seeds.17
    
- **Overfitting Risks (Sampling and Label Noise):** Meta-learners are susceptible to overfitting, both to the specific examples within few-shot tasks and to the overall distribution of meta-training tasks.
    
    - **Sampling Noise:** In the few-shot setting, the small support set may not be representative of the true task data distribution. Gradient updates based on these few examples can lead the model to overfit these specific instances, resulting in poor generalization on the query set and biased meta-updates.45
    - **Label Noise:** Meta-training often requires a large number of tasks, and acquiring perfectly labeled data for all of them can be difficult. Noisy labels in the support or query sets can significantly perturb the learning process and degrade the quality of the learned meta-parameters, making the model less effective at adapting to clean, unseen tasks.45 While methods like Eigen-Reptile aim to mitigate noise 45, it remains a concern. Prototypical Networks can also exhibit overfitting tendencies.33
    
- **Task Construction and Diversity:** The performance of meta-learning heavily relies on the distribution of tasks used during meta-training.22 Designing a set of tasks that is sufficiently diverse, representative of potential future tasks, and appropriately challenging is non-trivial. Often, tasks are created by partitioning existing datasets 28, which might not reflect true task variability. Generating meaningful tasks synthetically from unlabeled data is an ongoing research challenge.22 This task construction bottleneck is fundamental, as the core assumption of meta-learning is that meta-training tasks are drawn from the same distribution as meta-testing tasks.23 If this assumption is violated, or if the training distribution lacks diversity, the learned adaptation strategy may not generalize well. Progress in meta-learning algorithms must therefore be accompanied by advances in task curation and generation methodologies.
    
- **Benchmarking and Evaluation:** Establishing fair and comprehensive benchmarks for meta-learning in NLP is challenging.17 While benchmarks like Meta-Dataset exist for vision 40, NLP requires benchmarks covering a wider range of task types (classification, sequence labeling, generation, etc.) and complexities. Comparing meta-learning methods rigorously against strong, well-tuned baselines (e.g., standard fine-tuning with optimal hyperparameters, sophisticated prompting techniques for ICL) is crucial but often complex.17 Performance gains are not always guaranteed, and sometimes simpler baselines can be competitive.17
    
- **Architecture Constraints:** Some meta-learning algorithms, particularly early MAML formulations, might implicitly assume or work best when the model architecture is consistent across all tasks. This can pose challenges in cross-lingual or cross-problem settings where vocabularies or optimal architectures might differ.17 The advent of multilingual PLMs has partially mitigated this for cross-lingual tasks, but it remains a consideration for cross-problem meta-learning.
    
- **Applicability to Structured Prediction:** Adapting algorithms primarily designed for classification (like Prototypical Networks) to structured prediction tasks common in NLP (e.g., NER, RE, parsing) often requires non-trivial modifications, such as incorporating sequence models like CRFs or designing appropriate distance metrics for structured outputs.28
    
- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Performance:** A significant concern is that meta-learners optimized for rapid adaptation on a specific distribution of meta-training tasks may fail to generalize effectively to tasks that are substantially different (OOD).39 Some studies report that meta-tuning approaches can underperform standard pre-training followed by fine-tuning on OOD benchmarks.39 This points to an inherent tension: the strong optimization pressure towards learning _fast_ adaptation strategies for the known task distribution might lead the model to learn "shallow" or overly specialized mechanisms that lack robustness when faced with novel types of tasks.39 Addressing this may require explicitly incorporating OOD robustness into meta-learning objectives, potentially by balancing adaptation speed with the preservation of general features learned during pre-training.39
    

## 8. Synthesis and Future Directions

### 8.1 Comparative Overview

Meta-learning presents a diverse suite of techniques—primarily optimization-based (MAML, Reptile), metric-based (Prototypical Networks), and the LLM-specific Meta-ICL—to enhance the adaptability of BERT-style models and LLMs in few-shot NLP scenarios. Optimization-based methods focus on learning efficient ways to update model parameters (e.g., better initializations), enabling faster convergence during fine-tuning on new tasks. Metric-based methods learn representation spaces where task adaptation occurs via efficient comparisons, avoiding test-time gradient updates. Meta-ICL leverages meta-learning principles to explicitly train and improve the inherent in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, also allowing for gradient-free adaptation at inference time.

The choice among these approaches depends on factors like the specific NLP task, available computational resources, tolerance for training complexity, and whether test-time fine-tuning is feasible or desirable. Meta-ICL appears particularly well-suited for leveraging the unique strengths of modern LLMs. While meta-learning methods frequently demonstrate advantages over standard few-shot fine-tuning, particularly in very low-data regimes, the performance gains are not universal and depend significantly on factors like the number of shots, the diversity of meta-training tasks, and the quality of the baseline comparison.

### 8.2 Current Research Trends (2023-2025 Focus)

The field is actively evolving, with recent research (roughly 2023-2025) focusing on several key trends:

- **Refining Meta-In-Context Learning:** Continued exploration of methods to explicitly train LLMs for improved ICL performance, including recursive meta-ICL where models adapt their learning strategies based on sequences of in-context tasks.25
- **Prompt-Based Meta-Learning:** Integrating meta-learning with prompting techniques, including learning optimal discrete or continuous (soft) prompts, and meta-learning prompt initializations.14
- **Deeper Integration with LLM Lifecycle:** Moving beyond post-hoc application towards integrating meta-learning into continual pre-training (DAP-training) 51, establishing dedicated meta-tuning stages 38, and using meta-learning to guide fine-tuning processes like online adaptation via loss re-weighting.48
- **Scalability and Efficiency:** Developing computationally lighter meta-learning algorithms, favoring first-order methods, and exploring parameter-efficient meta-learning strategies suitable for massive LLMs.32
- **Robustness and Generalization:** Designing methods more robust to noise 45, mitigating overfitting in few-shot scenarios 33, and explicitly aiming to improve generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.39
- **Broader and Unified Applications:** Developing unified meta-models for broader functional areas like Information Extraction 49 or applying meta-learning principles to areas like LLM alignment, reward modeling, and online adaptation.48
- **Theoretical Foundations:** Seeking a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying meta-learning's effectiveness for LLMs, its theoretical connection to ICL 37, and formal guarantees on generalization properties.46
- **LLM Collaboration and Enhancement:** Using meta-learning concepts implicitly or explicitly in paradigms where models of different sizes collaborate, such as weak-to-strong generalization or speculative decoding.11

Recent publications and preprints from major conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) and arXiv during 2023-2025 reflect these trends, with work on Meta-ICL 35, continual learning/adaptation 48, alignment/reward modeling 56, optimization 53, and the general surge in LLM research driving related adaptation studies.11

### 8.3 Open Questions and Future Research Avenues

Despite progress, several open questions and promising avenues for future research remain:

- **Task Design for Generalization:** How can we systematically design or automatically generate meta-training task distributions that effectively capture real-world task diversity and explicitly promote robust OOD generalization in complex NLP settings?
- **Meta-Learning and ICL Theory:** What are the precise theoretical links between explicit meta-learning objectives (like those in MAML or Meta-ICL) and the emergence of ICL during large-scale pre-training? Can this understanding lead to more efficient pre-training strategies that directly foster strong ICL?
- **Continual Learning Beyond Pre-training:** Can meta-learning effectively address catastrophic forgetting when LLMs learn sequences of diverse _downstream_ tasks, beyond the domain-adaptive pre-training scenario?17
- **Meta-Learning and PEFT:** How can meta-learning principles be synergistically combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods (e.g., LoRA, Adapters) to achieve both data efficiency and computational efficiency when adapting LLMs? 53 explores BiDoRA, a bi-level optimization for LoRA, hinting at this direction.
- **Complex Generation Tasks:** How can meta-learning be effectively applied to complex, open-ended generation tasks (e.g., summarization, creative writing, complex dialogue) beyond current applications mostly focused on classification and extraction?
- **Scalable Algorithms for Transformers:** Developing novel meta-learning algorithms specifically tailored to the Transformer architecture and capable of scaling efficiently to models with trillions of parameters.
- **Robust NLP Benchmarking:** Creating standardized, comprehensive benchmarks and evaluation protocols for meta-learning in NLP that rigorously assess few-shot performance, adaptation speed, and, crucially, OOD generalization across diverse task types.

### 8.4 Existing Surveys and Resources

Researchers interested in this area can consult existing resources:

- A key survey is "Meta Learning for Natural Language Processing: A Survey" by Lee, Li, and Vu (NAACL 2022).16
- An earlier survey by Yin (2020) is also noted.17
- Workshops like MetaNLP, co-located with major NLP conferences (e.g., EMNLP 2021 18), provide focused venues for discussion.28
- Numerous general surveys on LLMs often include sections on adaptation techniques, few-shot learning, and ICL, providing broader context.3

The trajectory of research suggests a move towards more integrated, hybrid approaches. Rather than applying classical meta-learning algorithms in isolation, the trend is to combine their principles with the unique aspects of LLMs, such as their ICL ability 25, the flexibility of prompting 14, the power of pre-trained representations, and the necessity of efficient fine-tuning or adaptation strategies.38 Methods like Meta-ICL, prompt-based meta-learning, and meta-tuning exemplify this fusion. This indicates a maturation where the field is tailoring meta-learning concepts specifically for the LLM era, creating solutions that harness the strengths of multiple paradigms.

Furthermore, the motivation for applying meta-learning to LLMs appears twofold. While addressing data scarcity remains a core goal 16, the unique challenges posed by LLMs—their immense scale, computational cost 3, and the need for controllable adaptation 41—provide additional impetus. Meta-learning techniques that offer inference-time efficiency (Meta-ICL, metric-based) 17, faster fine-tuning convergence 17, or more explicit control over the adaptation process 14 are increasingly valuable not just for low-data scenarios, but for managing the practical deployment of these powerful models.

## 9. Conclusion

Meta-learning offers a powerful and evolving framework for addressing the critical challenge of adapting large, pre-trained language models like BERT and its successors to new tasks and domains within NLP, particularly under data constraints. This survey has outlined the core concepts, defining meta-learning as the process of learning to learn, distinct from yet increasingly interacting with paradigms like transfer learning and in-context learning.

Key algorithms such as the optimization-based MAML and Reptile, and the metric-based Prototypical Networks, have been successfully adapted for few-shot NLP tasks including text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction, often demonstrating significant improvements over standard fine-tuning baselines. A particularly promising recent development is Meta-In-Context Learning (Meta-ICL), which explicitly trains LLMs to enhance their innate ICL capabilities, offering efficient gradient-free adaptation at inference time.

The benefits of meta-learning are substantial, primarily revolving around improved sample efficiency, faster adaptation to new tasks, and potentially enhanced generalization across tasks and domains. However, significant challenges persist. Computational cost and scalability remain major hurdles for applying complex meta-learning algorithms to billion-parameter LLMs. Training stability, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and robustness to noise require careful consideration. Furthermore, the design of diverse and representative meta-training task distributions is crucial yet difficult, and robust benchmarking across varied NLP tasks, especially assessing out-of-distribution generalization, needs further development.

The interaction between meta-learning and the standard LLM training pipeline is deepening. Meta-learning is transitioning from a purely post-hoc adaptation technique to a more integrated component, influencing continual pre-training, dedicated meta-tuning stages, and the refinement of core LLM abilities like ICL. The trend is towards hybrid approaches that synergistically combine principles from meta-learning, prompting, ICL, and efficient fine-tuning, tailored to the unique characteristics of LLMs.

In conclusion, meta-learning provides indispensable tools for unlocking the full potential of LLMs by making them more adaptable, efficient, and generalizable. While practical and theoretical challenges remain, the ongoing research focused on scalability, robustness, task design, and deeper integration with the LLM lifecycle suggests that meta-learning will play an increasingly vital role in the future of NLP, enabling the deployment of powerful language understanding and generation capabilities in a wider array of real-world, dynamic, and data-constrained applications.
