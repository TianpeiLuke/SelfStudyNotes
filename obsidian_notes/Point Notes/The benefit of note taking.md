 > [!Question] 
 > **Why do we need to write notes ?** [^1]

A: We take notes because we need to remember the things we learned. Also we take notes because we want to externalize our thoughts. 

Our memory is short term, not accurate and when we remember things we tend to reinterpret them. This leads to inaccurate representations. The note-taking practice allows us to digest the information we collected. It is a process of writing, which is in turn a **process of memorization**. 

Our thoughts are fleeting things too. Not only we cannot retrieve correctly later on, we also forget completely what we thought of a thing. On the other hand, those that keep bothering us tends to linger in our mind. This increase our stressfulness, knowing that there are unfinished work. By writing our fleeting thoughts down in notes, we makes sure that we **capture** all information that is needed for future process, actions and thoughts. This is essential for _Getting Things Done (GTD)_ [^2]. 

Another benefit comes from the habit of **reviews**. Taking notes and review them regularly allows us to organize the information we collected and transform them into knowledge, perspective and action items. It is a thought-provoking process. By going over what we have written down, it is as if we were talking with other person, who left message to us and guided us to new work. 

Taking notes address both inaccurate memory issue and fleeting thoughts issues. It allows us to record our mental state on a particular matter immediately. The records should then be reviewed and organized to form our knowledge and system of thoughts.
