Grit = Character Strength, Courage and Perseverance

>Could achievement obtained by effort and skill alone ? 

The issue with the formula above is that *Grit* is not the only feature for success. The additional critical features for success include:

- **Luck**: Some results are obtained by luck. Luck is always down-played by self-improvement book but it is critical factor behind many successful stories in business, war and politics. It is not stressed since luck is not associated with characteristics of the individual thus violating the basic promise of all self-improvement book, i.e. everyone can success if they do X or Y. 
  
- **Right Direction**/**Vision**: Following the right direction is the pre-condition of achievement, but in the book *Grit* this is not stressed enough. That is because most of studies in the book are from education, competition, sports where the success criteria are well-defined. They are score based activity and thus the direction is to achieve the best score. In most domains, good direction is not obvious. Those who have the right vision would win at the starting point. Following the right direction, grit will lead to more suffer and less achievement. It is a life lesson to learn the right direction and to equip personal vision. This is the promise of the *7 Habits of Effective People* [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Book Summary]];

The main point is that we should **work smart not work hard**. We should understand what we want to achieve and why do we want to achieve it before we start working on it. If we realized that we are not in the right direction, we need to change direction. Do not worry about grit since grit becomes stubborn when we are not in the right direction. 

On the other hand, if we are certain that we are in the right direction, driven by passion or by vision, *grit* should be valued more than *talent* in our assessment on the possibility of success.
