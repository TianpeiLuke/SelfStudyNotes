>Here are a few tips to consider when creating your project budget:
> 
> - **Reference historical data:** 
> 	- Your project may be similar to a *previous project* your organization has worked on. 
> 	- It is important to review how that projectâ€™s budget was handled, find out what went well, and learn from any previous mistakes.
>     
> - **Utilize your team, mentors, or manager:** 
> 	- Get into the habit of asking for your team to *double check* your work to give you additional sets of eyes on your documents.
>     
> - **Time-phase** **your budget**: 
> 	- Time-phased budgeting allows you to allocate costs for project tasks over the *projected timeline* in which those expenses are planned to take place. 
> 	- By looking at your tasks against a timeline, you can track and compare planned versus actual costs over time and manage changes to your budget as necessary.
>     
> - **Check, check, and double check:** 
> 	- Make sure that your budget is *accurate and error-free*. 
> 	- Your budget will likely require *approval* from another department, such as finance or senior management, so do your best to ensure that it is as *straightforward to understand* as possible and that all of your calculations are correct.
