To form habits, we need to be aware of the cues and to control them. Here are some of habits that I form associated with cues from environments, tools as well as the group we are in

- cue:  gym (distance, space, availability) -> habit of exercise
- cue:  badminton court (distance, space, time) + friends who play badminton -> habit of badminton
- cue:  accessibility of book / audiobook software -> habit of book reading
- cue:  accessibility of note-taking software (obsidian, evernote) -> habit of note-taking 
- cue:  ipad -> habit of online/mobile gaming, gacha addict
- cue:  not having phone beside bed, covering window -> habit of good sleep
- cue:  tools (easy access, monitoring, linking, fast search, structured formatting) -> habit of getting things done (GTD) [[Getting Things Done as Habit]]

So to form new habit, we can work on our cues:


- Goal: form a habit of question-oriented research

	- tools:  Obsidian (note-taking, linking, thinking, writing),  Mendeley (paper reference), Evernote (knowledge base, reference)
	- environment: bigger table, dual screen,
