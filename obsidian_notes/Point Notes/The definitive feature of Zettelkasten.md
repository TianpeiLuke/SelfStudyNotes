> The method of ***Zettelkasten*** has several definitive features:  

- It promotes _the note-taking_ as a main activity while reading, learning and researching. Notes are pieces of information captured from books, papers and other materials. Notes are also used to take record of the *thoughts* from the readers/researcher. Unlike many existing note-taking methods, a Zettelkasten method requires readers to ***paraphrase*** and ***summarize*** the gist of the material into the readers’ own words. The notes need to be short and simple but capture the main ideas without referring to the context of the original material. 
  
- It _unified_ the format of notes regardless of the underlying materials and it stores all the notes _in one place_. Each note has an **atomic structure** and only record one piece of information. A Zettelkasten has three categories of notes: 
  
	- _Fleeting Notes_: capture On-the-Fly (OTF) raw information directly from the material. Information in fleeting notes are not to be kept in the system for long since it relies on the context of the original material to make sense. Summarization and Paraphrasing is required to process the Fleeting notes into Literature Notes and Permanent Notes. 
	  
	-  _Literature Notes_: capture the summaries, reviews, citations as well as other permanent information regarding the material read. Literature notes are required to be independent from the context of the original material: by reading the note itself, one can fully grasp the gist of the material without needing to re-read the book/papers. Literature notes are stored in a **_personal reference management system_**.
	  
	- _Permanent Notes_: capture the thoughts from note-taker. It is a critical step to make the thinking process written down in paper. Human brain like LLM has problem of hallucinating, which makes it neither precise nor reliable. Many ideas/thoughts have just a fleeting essence in our brain and they cannot be retrieved exactly as they were stored. The permanent notes are served as the _**second brain**_ as it keep the recordings of our past thinking to be reused sometimes later. A **slip-box** is referred to the storage of permanent notes.
	  
	A _**standardized**_ format of note-taking simplified the decision making for the readers so that they can focus on the _thinking_. By storing all notes in one place, it makes sure that all relevant information can be retrieved without remembering where it was stored. By **_categorization_** of the notes into three types, it allows us to differentiate our effort and to focus on the thinking instead of copying.   
	
- It produces a network of **_interconnected_** notes. When a permanent note is adding into the slip-box, questions are asked to connect it to existing permanent notes in the slip box. Connections between permanent notes directly are made due to their similar contents, their common relationships to a questions/a problem/a topic of interest as well as their cause-reason logical connections to existing notes. Similarly, connections between literature notes and permanent notes are made when a reference is made regarding the thinking, an extension of thoughts are made after reading etc. Connections are critical for slip-box since it allows _the compound effect_ to take place through **accumulation** of thoughts (notes) over time. Using the graph topology, a cluster of notes reveals the natural interest from the readers on a specific common problem without pre-defined terms. 
  
- It simplified the thinking and writing process. Both processes are **non-linear process** that requires back-and-forth among reading, thinking and writing. In order to fit an narrative a piece of information need to be dropped while the other information need to be included. These processes are also **trial-and-error process** that involves tinkering the ordering of the thoughts to present it in linear form. With notes as an atom form in the thinking and writing process, the effort of thinking and writing as a whole is effectively **decomposed** into smaller tasks. They are **_moving pieces_** as well. When we changed our thoughts, we can rearrange the notes with different ordering. Thus the slip-box provides the **necessary flexibility** to handle the non-linear process of thinking and writing.
