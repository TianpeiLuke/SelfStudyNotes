## Analytical Thinking:

- the abstract separation of a whole into its **constituent** parts in order to study the **parts** and their **relations**.

>[!example]
>- **Constituency Parsing**: Decomposition of sentence or paragraph into the *parts of speech (POS)*. [[Constituency Parsing]]
>- **Dependency Parsing**: [[Dependency Parsing]]

- Break **complex** object into *smaller components*, and study each component in detail

>[!example]
>Fourier series that decompose functions into linear combination of basis functions
>$$
>f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \alpha_{n} \exp \left(2\pi i\,  \omega_{n} x\right)
>$$

>[!example]
>Every element in Hilbert space can be decomposed according the a complete orthonormal basis $\{e_{i}\}$
>$$
> x =  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle  e_{i}\,,\,x    \right\rangle e_{i}
>$$

- Separate **a long time** project into a sequence of **tasks**, each can be *finished* within fixed amount of time.

>[!example]
>- Agile project planning [[The Lean Product Playbook Book Summary]]
  
- Reduce **complex** problem into **simpler, more fundamental** problem, each can be tackled within limited amount of time.

>[!example]
>- **Divide-and-Conquer** algorithm
>- **Dynamic Programming** algorithm

>[!example]
>- Understand **Fundamental** Deeply [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 1]]
>- Polya, G., &amp; Conway, J. H. (2014). *How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method(Reprint edition).* Princeton University Press.

- Continual change of behaviors in *long time*, which time taking **smaller steps**

>- Atomic Habits [[Atomic Habits Book Summary]]
>- Zettelkasten: [[How to Take Smart Note Book Summary]]


## Synethtic Thinking:

- **the combination of ideas into a complex whole**.

- Take the part as part of a larger whole

>[!example]
>Environmental Projects such as tackling the *Global Warming*

- Explain the **behavior** of the containing whole

>[!example]
>System Design Patterns


- Dis-aggregate the understanding of the whole into an **understanding of the parts**, to explain the *identifying role* or *function* of a **system** in the *larger system* of which it is a part.


>[!example]
>Control Theory and Information Theory
