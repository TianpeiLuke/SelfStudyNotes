In software engineering, there is a strategy called [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) . It is related to so-called *extreme programming*. The idea is simple: when facing uncertainty in development, **quickly making the best possible solution with as little as possible effort**.  Then test it in controlled environment, expecting it to fail. 

The idea of **Test-driven development (TDD)** is to ***make effective mistake** as soon as possible under a **controlled environment***. For complex problem, we are not expecting to grasp the whole picture of the problem. Therefore, mistakes and failures are inevitable. So instead of waiting for us to understand the entire picture, we find the best solution in our understanding and identity the gap using test environment. 

Since we design our own failure, we can effectively use it to guide us for the direction of improvement. It is always easier to improve upon an existing solution as compared to create a new one. 

Making mistakes and having failures is not a big issue esp. when we are in controlled environment. Therefore we should fully utilize the environment to **make effective mistake**.
