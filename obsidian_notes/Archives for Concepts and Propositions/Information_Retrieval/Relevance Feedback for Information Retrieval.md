## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Relevance Feedback for Information Retrieval

>[!important] Definition
>The idea of **relevance feedback (RF)** is to involve user in the retrieval process so as to improve the final result set.
>- The user would give *feedback* on the *relevance* of document in the *initial retrieved set.*
>
>The basic procedure for the **relevance feedback** is given by 
>- The user provides a *query*
>- The system returns an *initial set* of *retrieved results*
>- The user *marks* some of returned documents as *relevant* or *non-relevant*
>- The system computes a *better representation* of the information need based on the user feedback
>- The system displays a *revised set* of *retrieval results*
