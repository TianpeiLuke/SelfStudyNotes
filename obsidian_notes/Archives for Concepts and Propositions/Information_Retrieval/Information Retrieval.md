## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Information Retrieval

>[!important] Definition
>**Information retrieval** is the task of finding documents $d\in \mathcal{D}$ that are *relevant* to a userâ€™s need (*query*) $q$ for   information.

>[!important] Definition
>**Information retrieval (IR)** is finding material (usually documents) of an *unstructured nature* (usually text) that *satisfies* an *information need* from within large collections (usually stored on computers).

### Indexing

>[!important] Definition
>**Indexing** is the process to provide **index** for documents before *query* so that the system can avoid *linearly scanning*  the texts for each query.
