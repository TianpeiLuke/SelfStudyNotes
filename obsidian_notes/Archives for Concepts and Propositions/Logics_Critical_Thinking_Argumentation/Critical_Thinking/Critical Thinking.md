## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Critical Thinking

>[!important] Definition
>**Critical thinking** is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action. 
>
>In its exemplary form, it is based on *universal intellectual values* that transcend subject matter divisions: 
>- *clarity*, 
>- *accuracy*, 
>- *precision*, 
>- *consistency*, 
>- *relevance*, 
>- *sound evidence*, 
>- *good reasons*, 
>- *depth*, 
>- *breadth*, and *fairness*.

>[!important] Definition
>**Critical thinking** is that mode of thinking — about any subject, content, or problem — in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by *skillfully analyzing, assessing, and reconstructing* it. 
>
>**Critical thinking** is self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. 
>- It presupposes assent to *rigorous* standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. 
>- It entails *effective communication* and *problem-solving abilities*, as well as a commitment to *overcome our native egocentrism and sociocentrism*.

>[!info]
>**A well-cultivated critical thinker:**
> 
> - Raises *vital questions* and *problems*, *formulating* them *clearly and precisely*
> - Gathers and assesses *relevant information*, using abstract ideas to interpret it effectively
> - Comes to *well-reasoned conclusions* and *solutions*, *testing* them against relevant criteria and standards
> - Thinks *open-mindedly* within *alternative systems of thought,* recognizing and assessing, as needs be, their *assumptions*, *implications*, and *practical consequences*
> - *Communicates effectively* with others in figuring out solutions to complex problems



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Critical thinking can be seen as having *two components*: 
>1) a set of *information and belief* generating and processing skills, and 
>2) the *habit*, based on intellectual commitment, of using those skills to guide behavior. 
>
>It is thus to be *contrasted* with: 
>- 1) the *mere acquisition and retention* of *information* alone, because it involves *a particular way* in which information is sought and treated; 
>- 2) the *mere possession* of a set of *skills*, because it involves the *continual use* of them; and 
>- 3) the *mere use* of those *skills* ("as an exercise") *without* acceptance of their *results*.

>The ability to **think critically**, as conceived in this volume, involves three things: 
>1. an **attitude** of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences, 
>2. **knowledge of the methods** of *logical inquiry and reasoning*, and
>3. some **skill** in applying those methods. 
>
>Critical thinking calls for a persistent effort to *examine* any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the *evidence* that supports it and the further *conclusions* to which it tends. 
>
>It also generally requires ability 
>- to *recognize problems*, 
>- to *find workable means* for meeting those problems, 
>- to *gather* and marshal pertinent information, 
>- to *recognize unstated assumptions and values*, 
>- to comprehend and use *language* with *accuracy*, *clarity*, and *discrimination*, 
>- to *interpret data*, 
>- to appraise *evidence* and evaluate *arguments*, 
>- to recognize the existence (or non-existence) of *logical relationships* between propositions, 
>- to draw *warranted conclusions* and *generalizations*, 
>- to put to *test* the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives, 
>- to *reconstruct* one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of *wider experience*, and 
>- to render *accurate judgments* about specific things and qualities in everyday life.

>**Critical thinking** is self-guided, self-disciplined thinking which attempts to reason at the *highest level of quality* in a *fair-minded way*.   
>
>People who think critically 
>- consistently attempt to live *rationally*, *reasonably*, *empathically*.    
>- They are keenly aware of the inherently flawed nature of human thinking when left unchecked.   
>- They strive to diminish the power of their *egocentric and sociocentric tendencies*.   
>- They use the intellectual tools that critical thinking offers – concepts and principles that enable them to analyze, assess, and improve thinking.   
>- They work diligently to develop the intellectual virtues of intellectual integrity, intellectual humility, intellectual civility, intellectual empathy, intellectual sense of *justice and confidence in reason*.   
>- They realize that no matter how skilled they are as thinkers, they can *always improve* their reasoning abilities and they will at times fall prey to mistakes in reasoning, human irrationality, prejudices, biases, distortions, uncritically accepted social rules and taboos, self-interest, and vested interest.   
>- They strive to improve the world in whatever ways they can and contribute to a more rational, civilized society.    
>- At the same time, they *recognize the complexities* often inherent in doing so.   
>- They *avoid thinking simplistically* about complicated issues and strive to appropriately consider the rights and needs of relevant others.   
>- They recognize the complexities in developing as thinkers, and commit themselves to life-long practice toward self-improvement.   
>- They embody the *Socratic principle*:   The *unexamined life* is not worth living , because they realize that many unexamined lives together result in an uncritical, unjust, dangerous world.
