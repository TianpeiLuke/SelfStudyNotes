## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Self-Selection Bias
>
>In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), **self-selection bias** arises in any situation in which individuals select themselves into a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(sociology) "Group (sociology)"), causing a [biased sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biased_sample "Biased sample") with [nonprobability sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprobability_sampling "Nonprobability sampling"). It is commonly used to describe situations where *the characteristics* of the people which *cause* them to *select themselves in the group* create abnormal or undesirable conditions in the group. It is closely related to the [non-response bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-response_bias "Non-response bias"), describing when the group of people responding has different responses than the group of people not responding.
