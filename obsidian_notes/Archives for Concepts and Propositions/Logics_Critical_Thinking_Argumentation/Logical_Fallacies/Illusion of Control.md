## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Illusion of Control
>
>The illusion of control is the tendency for people to **overestimate their ability to control events**, for example, when someone feels *a sense of control over outcomes* that they demonstrably *do not influence*.[^1]


## Explanation

>[!quote]
>The illusion of control is the tendency to *believe that we can influence something over which we have absolutely no sway*. This was discovered in 1965 by two researchers, Jenkins and Ward. Their experiment was simple, consisting of just two switches and a light. The men were able to adjust when the switches connected to the light and when not. Even when the light flashed on and off at random, subjects were still convinced that they could influence it by flicking the switches.

>[!quote]
>Do you have everything under control? Probably less than you think. Do not think you command your way through life like a Roman emperor. Rather, you are the man with the red hat. Therefore, **focus on the few things of importance that you can really influence**. [^2] For everything else: *Que sera, sera.*
