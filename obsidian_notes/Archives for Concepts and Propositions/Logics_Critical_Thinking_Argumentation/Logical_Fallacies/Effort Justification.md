## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Effort Justification
>
>Effort justification is a person's tendency to *attribute the value* of an outcome they *put effort* into achieving as *greater* than *the objective value* of the outcome.

>[!info]
>**Cognitive dissonance theory** explains changes in people's attitudes or beliefs as the result of an attempt to reduce a dissonance (discrepancy) between contradicting ideas or [cognitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition "Cognition"). In the case of effort justification, there is a *dissonance* between *the amount of effort exerted into achieving a goal* or completing a task (high effort equalling high "cost") and *the subjective reward* for that effort (lower than was expected for such an effort). By adjusting and increasing one's attitude or subjective value of the goal, this dissonance is resolved.


## Explanation

>**When you put a lot of energy into a task, you tend to overvalue the result.** Because John had to endure physical pain for the parachute pin, it outshines all his other awards. And since Mark’s Harley cost him so many hours—and also nearly his wife—he prizes the bike so highly that he will never sell it.

>Effort justification is a special case of **“cognitive dissonance.”** To have a hole punched in your chest for a simple merit badge borders on the absurd. John’s brain *compensates for this imbalance* by *overvaluing the pin*, hyping it up from something mundane to something semi-sacred. All of this happens unconsciously and is difficult to prevent.

>**Groups use effort justification to bind members to them**—for example, through initiation rites. Gangs and fraternities initiate new members by forcing them to withstand nauseating or vicious tests. Research proves that *the harder the “entrance exam” is to pass, the greater the subsequent pride and the value they attach to their membership.* MBA schools play with effort justification in this way: They work their students day and night without respite, often to the point of exhaustion. Regardless of whether the coursework proves useful later on, once the students have the MBAs in the bag, they’ll deem the qualification essential for their careers simply because it demanded so much of them.

>Now that you know about effort justification, you can rate your projects more *objectively*. Try it out: *Whenever you have invested a lot of time and effort into something, stand back and examine the result*—**only the result.** The novel you’ve been tinkering with for five years and that no publisher wants: Perhaps it’s not Nobel-worthy after all.
