## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Anchoring Effect
>
>The **anchoring effect** is a psychological phenomenon in which an *individual's judgements* or *decisions* are *influenced by a reference point* or **"anchor"** which can be **completely irrelevant**. Both numeric and non-numeric anchoring have been reported in research. In numeric anchoring, once the value of the anchor is set, subsequent arguments, estimates, etc. made by an individual may change from what they would have otherwise been without the anchor.
