## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Confirmation Bias
>
>**Confirmation bias** (also **confirmatory bias**, [**myside bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#cite_note-2) or **congeniality bias** [^2] ) is the tendency to *search for*, *interpret*, *favor*, and *recall* information in a way that *confirms* or supports one's *prior beliefs* or *values*. [^3]

## Explanation


>[!info]
>People display this bias 
>- when they **select information that supports their views**, 
>- when they **ignoring contrary information**, or 
>- when they interpret *ambiguous evidence* as **supporting their existing attitudes**.

>[!quote]
>Confirmation bias is the tendency of people to *favor information that **confirms or strengthens** their **beliefs or values*** and is difficult to dislodge once affirmed. [^4]

>The confirmation bias is the mother of all misconceptions. It is the tendency to *interpret new information* so that it becomes **compatible with our existing theories, beliefs, and convictions.** In other words, we **filter out** any new information that **contradicts** our existing views ("disconfirming evidence"). This is a dangerous practice. "Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored," said writer Aldous Huxley. However, we do exactly that, as super-investor Warren Buffett knows: "What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact."

>*Religious and philosophical beliefs* represent an excellent breeding ground for the confirmation bias. ...

>No professionals suffer more from the confirmation bias than *business journalists*. Often, they formulate an easy theory, pad it out with two or three pieces of "evidence," and call it a day. ...

>*Self-help* and *get-rich-quick books* are further examples of blinkered storytelling. Their shrewd authors collect piles of proof to pump up the most banal of theories, such as "meditation is the key to happiness." Any reader seeking disconfirming evidence does so in vain: Nowhere in these books do we see people who lead fulfilled lives without meditation, or those who, despite meditation, are still sad.
>
>*The Internet* is particularly fertile ground for the confirmation bias. To stay informed, we browse news sites and blogs, forgetting that our favored pages mirror our existing values, be they liberal, conservative, or somewhere in between. Moreover, a lot of sites now *tailor content to personal interests and browsing history*, causing new and divergent opinions to vanish from the radar altogether. We inevitably land in *communities of like-minded people*, *further reinforcing our convictions*—and the confirmation bias.

>To fight against the confirmation bias, try *writing down your beliefs*—whether in terms of worldview, investments, marriage, health care, diet, or career strategies—and set out to find disconfirming evidence. Axing beliefs that feel like old friends is hard work but imperative. [^5]
