## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Zeigarnik Effect
>
>In [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), the **Zeigarnik effect**, named after Lithuanian-Soviet psychologist [Bluma Zeigarnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluma_Zeigarnik "Bluma Zeigarnik"), occurs when an *activity* that has been *interrupted* may be more *readily* [recalled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory) "Recall (memory)"). It postulates that people remember **unfinished or interrupted tasks** *better than* **completed tasks**. In [Gestalt psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology "Gestalt psychology"), the Zeigarnik effect has been used to demonstrate the general presence of Gestalt phenomena: not just appearing as perceptual effects, but also present in cognition.



## Explanation

>In Berlin, 1927, a group of university students and professors ventured into a restaurant. Despite the flurry of orders, including special requests, the waiter memorized everything without jotting down a single note. Anticipating disaster, the diners were pleasantly surprised when each received exactly what they ordered after a brief wait. Later, outside on the street, *Bluma Zeigarnik*, a Russian psychology student, realized she had left her *scarf* behind. Returning to the restaurant, she approached the waiter with the reputed incredible memory. However, he stared back blankly, utterly clueless about her identity or where she had sat. Indignant, she questioned how he could forget, especially given his renowned memory. The waiter curtly responded, "*I keep every order in my head—until it is served.*"

>**Unfinished tasks tend to linger in our minds, refusing to be forgotten.** Like persistent children, they continuously tug at our attention until we address them. However, **once a task is completed and checked off our mental list, it vanishes from our memory.**

>David Allen, the author of the bestselling book "Getting Things Done," [[Getting Things Done Book Summary]] argues that he has one goal: to have a head as clear as water. For this, you don’t need to have your whole life sorted into tidy compartments. But it does mean that you need a detailed plan for dealing with the messier areas. This plan must be divided into *step-by-step tasks* and *preferably written down*. *Only when this is done can your mind rest.* The adjective “detailed” is important. “Organize my wife’s birthday party” or “find a new job” are worthless. Allen forces his clients to split such projects into twenty to fifty individual tasks. 
>
>It’s worth noting that Allen’s recommendation seems to fly in the face of the planning fallacy (chapter 91): [[Planning Fallacy]] the more detailed our planning, the more we tend to overlook factors from the periphery that will derail our projects. But here is the rub: If you want peace of mind, go for Allen’s approach. If you want the most accurate estimate on cost, benefit, and duration of a project, *forgot your detailed plan* and *look up similar projects*. If you want both, do both.

>Fortunately, you can do all this yourself with the aid of a decidedly low-tech device. Place a notepad by your bed. The next time you cannot get to sleep, jot down outstanding tasks and how you will tackle them. This will silence the cacophony of inner voices.

- We can use the Zeigarnik effect to reduce the burden of our mind. By writing down the plan and next step, our mind would treat it as if it has been completed. Thus forget it easily. With good note-taking system, we can safely assure that we do not lose information but remove them from our brain.
