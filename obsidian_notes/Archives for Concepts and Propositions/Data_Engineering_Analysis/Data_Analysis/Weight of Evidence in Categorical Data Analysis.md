## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:

- **Weight of Evidence (WoE)**Â will help us to determine which categories should be binned together. WOE measures the strength of a bin in differentiating the Good and Bad accounts. WOE < 0 indicates that the variable bin is captures higher proportion of bad accounts.

- [[Information Value for Predictive Power of Categorical Data]]

## Explanation


- [[Risk Table for Categorical Data Analysis]]
- [[Logistic Regression]]

### Usage

- Popular in **credit risk modeling**
- Handles **ordinal relationship** better
- Used in **logistic regression** models for interpretability


## Related
