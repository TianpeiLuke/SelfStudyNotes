## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: 

>[!important]
>A **risk table** maps each category (or combination of categories) of a categorical variable to the *observed outcome rate*.
>- *Risk table* is often interpreted as a *risk*, *probability*, or *proportion* of a particular class.

## Explanation



### Use Cases

>[!info]
> - **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
>     - Helps understand association between categories and outcomes.
>         
> - **Modeling**:
>     - Used for **target encoding**, where categories are replaced by their risk (target mean).
>     - Helps detect **high-risk groups** in fraud, medical diagnosis, marketing, etc.
>         
> - **Fairness Audits**:
>     - Evaluates if certain groups experience higher negative outcomes.

### Additional Concerns

>[!info]
>- Risk tables should be computed **only on training data** to avoid data leakage.
>     
> - Small groups can have unstable risk estimates â€” **smoothing** (e.g., **Bayesian target encoding**) is often needed.
>     
> - For *multiclass outcomes*, risk tables can be extended to show per-class proportions.
