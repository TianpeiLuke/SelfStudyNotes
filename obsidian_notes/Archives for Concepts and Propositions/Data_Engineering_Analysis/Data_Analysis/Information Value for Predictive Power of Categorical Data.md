## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: 

- [[Binning as Categorical Feature Transformation]]

- [[Weight of Evidence in Categorical Data Analysis]]


- **Information Value (IV)**Â will help in determining which variables are useful for prediction in the logistic regression model. IV is the measure of overall predictive power of the variables and is very useful for feature selection.

### IV for Variable Predictive

|Information Value|Variable Predictiveness|
|---|---|
|Less than 0.02|Not useful for prediction|
|0.02 to 0.1|Weak predictive Power|
|0.1 to 0.3|Medium predictive Power|
|0.3 to 0.5|Strong predictive Power|
|>0.5|Suspicious Predictive Power|



## Explanation

>[!important]
>The *Information Value (IV)* used in credit scoring and categorical feature evaluation is mathematically **equivalent** to the discrete form of the **symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence** or **Jensen-Shanon divergence (JSD)** between two probability distributions:


- [[Logistic Regression]]
- [[Kullback-Leibler Divergence]]
- [[Jensen-Shannon Divergence]]


### Usage

- Feature selection
- Model interpretation
- Ranking variable importance
