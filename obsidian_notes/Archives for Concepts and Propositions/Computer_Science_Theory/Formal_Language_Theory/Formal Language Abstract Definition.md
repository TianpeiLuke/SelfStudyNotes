## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Formal Language Abstract Definition

![[Alphabets and Strings Abstract Definition#^339899]]

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\Sigma$ be an *alphabet*.
>
>A set of *strings* all of which are chosen from $\Sigma^{*}$ is called a **formal language** *over* $\Sigma$. $$L \subseteq \Sigma^{*}.$$
>- In computer science, *formal language* is often abbreviated as **language**.
