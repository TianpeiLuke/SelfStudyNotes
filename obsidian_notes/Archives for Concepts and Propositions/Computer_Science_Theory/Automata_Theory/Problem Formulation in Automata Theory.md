## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Problem Formulation in Automata Theory

![[Alphabets and Strings Abstract Definition#^339899]]

 ![[Formal Language Abstract Definition#^820f46]]
>[!important] Definition
>A **problem** in **automata theory** is the question of deciding whether or not a given *string* is a *member* of some particular *language*.
>
>Let $\Sigma$ be an *alphabet* and $L \subseteq \Sigma^{*}$ is a *language over* $\Sigma$
>
>Then the **problem** $L$ is formulated as
>> Given a string $w\in \Sigma^{*}$, decide if $w\in L$.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>**Languages** and **problems** are really the **same thing**. 
>- Which term we prefer to use depends on our *point of view*. 
>	- When we care only about *strings* for their *own sake* 
>		- e.g. in the set $$\{ 0^n\,1^{n}: \; n\ge 1 \}$$ then we tend to think of the set of strings as a *language* 
>		- In the last chapters of this book we shall tend to assign **semantics** to the *strings* e.g. think of strings as *coding graphs*, *logical expressions* or even *integers* 
>	- In those cases where we care more about the thing *represented by the string* than the string itself we shall tend to think of *a set of strings* as a **problem**
