## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: 



- [[NP Complexity Class and Problems]]

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>That said, there are some problems that appear to be **NP-hard** yet are **not in NP**. 
>- These problems might be even **harder than NP-complete**! 
>- **Two-player games** such as chess provide examples of problems that are not in NP.
