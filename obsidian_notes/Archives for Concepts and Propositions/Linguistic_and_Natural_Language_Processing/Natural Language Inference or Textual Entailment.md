## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Natural Language Inference or Textual Entailment

>[!important] Definition
>The task of **natural language inference (NLI)** or recognizing **textual entailment (TE)**, is to identify the *directional relationship* between a pair of sentences.
>- The relation holds whenever the *truth* of one sentence follows from another sentence.
>
>In the *TE* framework, 
>- the *entailing* sequence is called **text (t)** 
>- and *entailed* sequence are is called  **hypothesis (h)**,
>- We represent the relation "*t entails h*" as $$t \Vdash h$$ which means that a human reading $t$ woudl *more likely to infer* $h$ is true.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>A characteristic of natural language is that there are many different ways to state what one wants to say: several meanings can be contained in a single text and the same meaning can be expressed by different texts. This *variability of semantic expression* can be seen as the dual problem of **language ambiguity**. 
>
>Together, they result in a many-to-many mapping between *language expressions* and *meanings*. 
>- The task of **paraphrasing** involves recognizing when two texts have the *same meaning* and creating a similar or shorter text that conveys almost the same information. 
>- **Textual entailment** is similar but *weakens the relationship* to be **unidirectional**. 
>	- Mathematical solutions to establish textual entailment can be based on the *directional property* of this relation, by making a comparison between some directional similarities of the texts involved.

## Solution

>[!quote]
>*Textual entailment* measures **natural language understanding**  as it asks for a *semantic interpretation* of the text, and due to its generality remains an active area of research. 
>
>Many approaches and refinements of approaches have been considered, such as
>- **word embedding**, 
>- **logical models**, 
>- **graphical models**, 
>- rule systems, 
>- contextual focusing, 
>- and *machine learning*.
>
>Practical or large-scale solutions avoid these complex methods and instead use only **surface syntax** or **lexical relationships**, but are correspondingly less accurate.
