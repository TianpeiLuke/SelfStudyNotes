## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: 

>[!quote]
>In the context of natural language processing (NLP) and specifically "aspect-based summarization," the term "**aspect**" refers to **distinct components**, **features**, or **attributes** of the **subject** *being analyzed or summarized.* **Aspect-based summarization** aims to create *summaries* that **highlight specific aspects** of the content rather than providing a general overview.
> 
> For example, in the context of product reviews, aspects might include features like "battery life," "design," "performance," and "price." An aspect-based summarizer would extract and summarize information related to each of these aspects separately. This allows users to quickly understand opinions and information related to particular features they are interested in, rather than reading through entire reviews.
> 
> In essence, "aspect" in this context helps to organize and categorize the information based on different criteria or attributes, enabling more targeted and detailed summaries.
