### Punctuations

>[!important] Definition
>The **punctuations** are the marks used in writing to *separate sentences* and their *elements* and to *clarify meaning*.
>
>It indicates how to read a written piece of text and consequently how it was understood.

>[!example]
>There are $14$ commonly used **punctuations**, grouped according its functionality:
>- Sentence endings:
>	- **period** `.`
>		-  Also referred to as a **full stop**, the period denotes the end of a sentence. A full sentence is considered as one that is complete and declarative.
>	- **question mark** `?`
>		- A question mark also ends a sentence, however it ends a sentence that is a *direct question*. 
>		- Typically, sentences that are questions begin with what, how, when, where, why, or who.
>		- Generally, a question mark also *denotes a shift in tone* in a sentence if it’s being read out loud, so this is something to take note of.
>	- **exclamation point** `!`
>		- An exclamation point or exclamation mark is also used at the end of a sentence when that sentence expresses an *intense emotion*. 
>		- The expression can be a variety of things, from excitement, disgust, anger, joy, or anything else. 
>		- Exclamation points are meant to *add emphasis* to a sentence.
>- Link within one sentence:
>	- **comma** `,`  
>		- Commas are used to insert a *pause* into a sentence. The purpose of the pause can be for different reasons, such as to separate ideas, phrases, or even alter the structure of a sentence.
>		- Commas are one of the most misused punctuation points, and its misuse often results in a *comma splice*. 
>		- A *comma splice* is when you join two *independent clauses* with a comma instead of a *conjunction*.
>	- **colon** `:`
>		- used to *precede* a list of items, a quotation, or an expansion or explanation.
>		- A colon has *three primary uses*. 
>			- One way to use it is when *introducing something*, such as a quote, an example, a series, or an explanation.
>			- A colon can also be used to *link two independent clauses* if the second clause clarifies or completes the first one.
>	- **semicolon** `;` 
>		- commonly used to link (in a single sentence) two independent clauses that are closely related in thought
>		- Similar to a colon, a semicolon links *two independent clauses*. 
>		- However, in this case, the clauses are *more closely related* than when you would use a colon.
>		- Both clauses are *independent enough* to be their own sentences, but instead of using a period, it’s possible to use a semicolon to show both clauses are connected.
>- Link between part-of-words, words and clauses:
>	- **dash** `--`
>		- used between phrases or clauses *(groups of words)*
>	- **hypen** `-`
>		- only used between *prefixes* and words to make *compound* words
>- Grouping
>	- **parentheses** `()`
>	- **bracket** `[]`
>	- **braces** `{}`
>- Others
>	- **quotation marks** `""`
>	- **apostrophe** `'`
>		- indicate either *possession* (e.g., `Harry's book` ; `boys' coats` ) or the *omission* of letters or numbers
>	- **ellipsis** `...`
>		- They are often used to *jump* from one sentence or phrase to another while *omitting* unnecessary or obvious words. 
>		- It’s also used when *quoting* someone and unnecessary words are *left out*.

>[!info] 
>In western languages (English, French, German, Spanish etc.), **punctuation** 
>- is critical to find the *boundary* of word and sentence, 
>- and it is critical to identify some aspects of the *meaning*. 

>[!info]
>In **British English**, *punctuation marks* such as full stops and commas are placed **inside** the quotation mark **only** if they are *part* of what is *being quoted*, and placed **outside** the closing quotation mark if part of the containing sentence.
>
 >In **American English**, however, such punctuation is *generally placed inside* the closing quotation mark regardless.
