## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Docker Container Images

![[Container as Microservice#^0d486a]]

- [[Container as Microservice]]
- [[Microservice Definition]]
- [[Infrastructure as Code for Continuous Delivery]]

>[!important] Definition
>**Container Image**Â is a *lightweight*, *stand-alone*, *executable* software package allowing code to run quickly and reliably *across environments*.

>[!important] Definition 
>**Docker container images** are *lightweight, executable packages* that include everything you need in it.
> 
>- All of your *application code*, 
>- *software*, 
>- *dependencies*, 
>- and *configuration variables*.
> 
>They are considered *read-only artifacts*.
>- Once an image is built, it *cannot be changed* unless you build a new image.
>- Docker Images can be stored in **Image Registry** from which an image can be *pulled and run* on a machine or host

### Union File System

>[!important] Definition 
> Docker uses what is called a **union file system** for the efficient storage of these layers, or what you can think of as the *building blocks* for container.
> 
>
>A union file system allows you to *overlay multiple layers* so that they appear as a *unified view* to the container.
> 
>- If a file that exists in a *lower layer* needs to be modified, it would be *copied* to the **modifying layer**, not modifying the copy from the lower layer.
>	- Note that Docker images are *read-only*. So in order to make changes, Docker mounts a **writeable layer** on the *top* of the lower **read-only layers**.
> 
>- This *writeable layer* allows any processes or applications running inside the container a place to *modify* or *create files*.
>- The read-only version of the file would remain *unchanged*, but is now *hidden underneath* the copy in the writeable layer.
>  
>This is called the **copy-on-write strategy**.

>[!info]
>By using the **copy-on-write strategy**,  all of the *read-only layers* of the image remain unchanged, which means that they can be *shared* by *multiple different running container instances*.
>- So the image is shared, but each container gets its **own writeable top layer**.
>- This writeable top layer stays *relatively small* by only bringing data into the writeable layer when needed.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>You can *pass* **configuration data** into the containers *at runtime*, through **environment variables** or through **volumes**.
