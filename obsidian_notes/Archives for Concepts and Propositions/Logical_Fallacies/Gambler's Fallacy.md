## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Gambler's Fallacy
>
>The **gambler's fallacy**, also known as the **Monte Carlo fallacy** or the **fallacy of the maturity of chances**, is the belief that, if an event (whose occurrences are [independent and identically distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables "Independent and identically distributed random variables")) has occurred *more frequently than expected*, it is *less likely to happen again* in the future (or vice versa). The [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy "Fallacy") is commonly associated with [gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling "Gambling"), where it may be believed, for example, that the next dice roll is more than usually likely to be six because there have recently been fewer than the [expected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value "Expected value") number of sixes.
