## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Impostor Syndrome
>
>**Impostor syndrome**, also known as **impostor phenomenon** or **impostorism**, is a psychological occurrence. Those who have it may *doubt their skills, talents, or accomplishments*. They may have a persistent [internalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalizing_disorder "Internalizing disorder") fear of being exposed as frauds.[^1] Despite *external evidence of their competence*, those experiencing this phenomenon *do not believe* they deserve their success or luck. They may think that they are deceiving others because they feel as if they are not as intelligent as they outwardly portray themselves to be.[^2] Impostor syndrome can stem from and result in *strained personal relationships* and can hinder people from *achieving their full potential* in their fields of interest.[^3] The term "impostorization" shifts the source of the phenomenon away from the supposed impostor to institutions whose policies, practices, or workplace cultures "either make or intend to make individuals question their intelligence, competence, and sense of belonging."[^4]
