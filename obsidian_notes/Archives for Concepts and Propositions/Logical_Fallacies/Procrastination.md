## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Procrastination
>
>**Procrastination** is the act of *unnecessarily and voluntarily delaying or postponing something* despite knowing that there will be *negative consequences* for doing so. It is a common human experience involving delays in everyday chores or even putting off tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment, or broaching a stressful issue with a partner. It is not always associated with stress. It can also be during the aftermath of stress or a stressful event. *Productivity* is low during times of health issues. It is often *perceived as a negative trait* due to its hindering effect on one's [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity "Productivity"), associated with [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood) "Depression (mood)"), low [self-esteem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem "Self-esteem"), guilt, and feelings of inadequacy.[^1] However, it can also be considered a wise response to certain demands that could present risky or negative outcomes or require waiting for new information to arrive.[^2]



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>The period of *self-control* had drained their *mental energy—or willpower*—which they now needed to solve the problem. Willpower is like a battery, at least in the short term. If it is *depleted*, future challenges will falter.

>So get over yourself. Procrastination is *irrational but human*. To fight it, use a combined approach. This is how my neighbor managed to write her doctoral thesis in three months: She rented a tiny room with neither telephone nor internet connection. She set three dates, one for each part of the paper. She told anyone who would listen about these deadlines and even printed them on the back of her business cards. *This way, she transformed personal deadlines into public commitments.* At lunchtime and in the evenings, she refueled her batteries by reading fashion magazines and sleeping a lot.
