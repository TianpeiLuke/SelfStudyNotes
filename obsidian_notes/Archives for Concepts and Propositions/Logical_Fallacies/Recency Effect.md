## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Recency Effect or *Recency Bias*
>
>**Recency bias** is a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias "Cognitive bias") that *favors recent events over historic ones*; a [memory bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_bias "Memory bias"). Recency bias gives *"greater importance to the most recent event"*,[^1] such as the final lawyer's closing argument a jury hears before being dismissed to deliberate.


>[!info]
>Recency bias should not be confused with [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias) "Anchoring (cognitive bias)") or [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias "Confirmation bias"). Recency bias is related to the [serial-position effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect "Serial-position effect") known as the [recency effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_effect "Recency effect"). It is not to be confused with [recency illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_illusion "Recency illusion"), the belief or impression that a word or language usage is of recent origin when in reality it is long-established.



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>The primacy effect is not always the culprit; *the contrasting “recency effect” matters as well.* **The more recent the information, the better we remember it.** This occurs because our short-term memory file drawer, as it were, contains very little extra space. When a new piece of information gets filed, an older piece of information is discarded to make room.

>When does the primacy effect supersede the recency effect, or vice versa? If you have to **make an immediate decision** based on *a series of “impressions”* (such as characteristics, exam answers, etc.), **the primacy effect weighs heavier**. But if *the series of impressions was formed* **some time ago**, **the recency effect dominates**. For instance, if you listened to a speech a few weeks ago, you will remember the final point or punch line more clearly than your first impressions.

>In conclusion: **First and last impressions dominate**, meaning the content sandwiched between has only a weak influence. Try to avoid evaluations based on first impressions. They will deceive you, guaranteed, in one way or another. *Try to assess all aspects impartially*. It’s not easy, but there are ways around it. For example, in interviews, I jot down a score every five minutes and calculate the average afterward. This way, I make sure that the “middle” counts just as much as hello and good-bye.
