## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Cognitive Dissonance
>
>In the field of [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), **cognitive dissonance** is described as the mental discomfort people feel when their beliefs and actions are *inconsistent and contradictory*, ultimately making them *change one factor* (either their beliefs or actions) to *align better*.[^1] Relevant items of information include peoples' actions, feelings, [ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideas "Ideas"), [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs "Beliefs"), [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics) "Value (ethics)"), and things in the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment"). Cognitive dissonance is typically experienced as [psychological stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_stress "Psychological stress") when persons participate in an action that goes against one or more of those things. According to this theory, when an **action** or **idea** is psychologically *inconsistent* with the other, people do all in their power to *change either* so that they become consistent. The discomfort is triggered by the person's **belief clashing with new information perceived**, wherein the individual tries to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.[^1]
