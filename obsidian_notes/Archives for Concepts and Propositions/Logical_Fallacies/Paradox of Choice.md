## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Paradox of Choice
>
> The dramatic explosion in choice—from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs—has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution and how *our obsession with choice* encourages us to *seek that which makes us feel worse*.

>[!info]
>_**The Paradox of Choice – Why More Is Less**_ is a book written by American [psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist "Psychologist") [Barry Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Schwartz_(psychologist) "Barry Schwartz (psychologist)") and first published in 2004 by [Harper Perennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_Perennial "Harper Perennial").

The book analyses the behavior of different types of people (in particular, maximizers and [satisficers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing)).
