## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Overconfidence Effect
>
>The **overconfidence effect** is a well-established [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias "Cognitive bias") in which a person's **subjective confidence** in their judgments is reliably *greater than* the **objective accuracy** of those judgments, especially when confidence is relatively high.[^1] [^2] Overconfidence is one example of a miscalibration of [subjective probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_probability "Subjective probability"). Throughout the research literature, overconfidence has been defined in three distinct ways: (1) **overestimation** of one's actual performance; (2) **overplacement** of one's performance relative to others; and (3) **overprecision** in expressing unwarranted certainty in the accuracy of one's beliefs.[^2] [^3]


## Explanation

>[!quote]
>The overconfidence effect also applies to *forecasts*, such as stock market performance over a year or your firm's profits over three years. We **systematically overestimate our knowledge and our ability to predict**—on a massive scale. *The overconfidence effect does not deal with whether single estimates are correct or not.* Rather, it measures the *difference between what people really know* and *what they think they know.* What's surprising is this: Experts suffer even more from the overconfidence effect than laypeople do. If asked to forecast oil prices in five years' time, an economics professor will be as wide of the mark as a zookeeper will. However, the professor will offer his forecast with certitude.

>The overconfidence effect does not stop at economics: In surveys, 84 percent of Frenchmen estimate that they are above-average lovers. Without the overconfidence effect, that figure should be exactly 50 percent—after all, the statistical "median" means 50 percent should rank higher and 50 percent should rank lower.

>Hardly any major projects exist that are completed in *less time and at a lower cost than forecasted.* ... Here, **two effects** act in union. First, you have the classic *overconfidence effect*. Second, those with a *direct interest* in the project have an **incentive** *to underestimate the costs*: consultants, contractors, and suppliers seek follow-up orders. Builders feel bolstered by the optimistic figures, and through their activities, politicians get more votes.

>What makes the overconfidence effect so prevalent and its effect so confounding is that it is *not driven by incentives*; **it is raw and innate**. And it's *not counterbalanced* by the opposite effect, *"underconfidence,"* which doesn't exist.
