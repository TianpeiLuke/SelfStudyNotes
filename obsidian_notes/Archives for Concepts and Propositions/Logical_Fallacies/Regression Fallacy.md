## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Regression Fallacy
>
>The **regression** (or **regressive**) **fallacy** is an [informal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy "Informal fallacy"). It assumes that something has *returned to normal* because of corrective actions taken while *it was abnormal*. This fails to account for **natural fluctuations**. It is frequently a special kind of [the post hoc fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc "Post hoc ergo propter hoc").



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>*Extreme performances are interspersed with less extreme ones.* The most successful stock picks from the past three years are hardly going to be the most successful stocks in the coming three years. Knowing this, you can appreciate why some athletes would rather not make it on to the front pages of the newspapers: Subconsciously they know that the next time they race, they probably won't achieve the same top result—which has nothing to do with the media attention, but with **natural variations in performance.**

>[!quote]
>Ignoring **regression to the mean** can have *destructive consequences*, such as teachers (or managers) concluding that the stick is better than the carrot. For example, following a test, the highest-performing students are praised and the lowest are castigated. In the next exam, other students will probably—purely coincidentally—achieve the highest and lowest scores. Thus, the teacher concludes that reproach helps and praise hinders: a fallacy that keeps on giving.
