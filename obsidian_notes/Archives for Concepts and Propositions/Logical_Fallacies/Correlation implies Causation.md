## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Correlation implies Causation or *Cum hoc ergo propter hoc*
>
>The phrase "**correlation does not imply causation**" refers to the inability to legitimately deduce a [cause-and-effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality") relationship between two events or [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(research) "Variable (research)") *solely on the basis of an observed association* or [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation "Correlation") between them. [^1][^2] The idea that "correlation implies causation" is an example of a [questionable-cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionable_cause "Questionable cause") [logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy#logical "Fallacy"), in which two events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known by the Latin phrase _**cum hoc ergo propter hoc**_ ('with this, therefore because of this'). This differs from the fallacy known as _[post hoc ergo propter hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc "Post hoc ergo propter hoc")_ ("after this, therefore because of this"), in which an event following another is seen as a [necessary consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence") of the former event, and from [conflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflation "Conflation"), the errant merging of two events, ideas, databases, etc., into one.
