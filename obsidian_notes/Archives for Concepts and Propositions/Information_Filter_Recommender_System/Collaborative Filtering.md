## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Collaborative Filtering

>[!important] Definition
>**Collaborative Filtering** is a recommendation technique that predicts a user's preferences by analyzing patterns of likes, ratings, or behaviors across many users, 
>- under the *assumption* that users with *similar past behaviors* will prefer *similar items in the future*.


- [[User-Item Preference and Rating for Recommendation]]

>[!important]
>Instead of relying on the content of the items themselves, collaborative filtering focuses purely on *relationships between users and items*, learning from the structure of **user-item interactions**.
