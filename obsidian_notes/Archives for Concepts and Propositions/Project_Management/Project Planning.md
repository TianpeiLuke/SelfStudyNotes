## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Planning

### Benefits of Planning

>[!quote]
>Planning has many **benefits**. As we've discussed, planning helps you map out the *full project*.
> - It helps you understand the *work needed* to achieve your goals.
> - Planning also helps *coordinate efforts* and *timelines* with other teams, contractors, and vendors.
> - Another huge benefit of planning is that it gives you time to *identify* and *prepare for risks* that could impact your project.
> 	- Those might include things like a delay in the timeline, the departure of a critical team member, or a change in project direction from a primary stakeholder.
> - Planning also gives you the chance to brainstorm ways to *mitigate* or *address those risks*.
> 
>There are less obvious benefits too.
>- For example, the planning phase can help you *get "buy-in"* from key members of the project team.
>	- Getting buy-in means that you've gained their support for your plans.
>- Planning also *demonstrates to stakeholders* that the team is taking care to start the project with a detailed plan.
>- But one of the most significant benefits of planning is *teamwork*, which will help you push your project across the finish line.
>	- By working together in the planning phase, individuals assigned to the project can become a *strong team* by *the time the planning is done* and the work is about to start.
