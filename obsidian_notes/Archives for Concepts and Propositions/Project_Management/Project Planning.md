## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Planning

### Benefits of Planning

>[!quote]
>Planning has many **benefits**. As we've discussed, planning helps you map out the *full project*.
> - It helps you understand the *work needed* to achieve your goals.
> - Planning also helps *coordinate efforts* and *timelines* with other teams, contractors, and vendors.
> - Another huge benefit of planning is that it gives you time to *identify* and *prepare for risks* that could impact your project.
> 	- Those might include things like a delay in the timeline, the departure of a critical team member, or a change in project direction from a primary stakeholder.
> - Planning also gives you the chance to brainstorm ways to *mitigate* or *address those risks*.
> 
>There are less obvious benefits too.
>- For example, the planning phase can help you *get "buy-in"* from key members of the project team.
>	- Getting buy-in means that you've gained their support for your plans.
>- Planning also *demonstrates to stakeholders* that the team is taking care to start the project with a detailed plan.
>- But one of the most significant benefits of planning is *teamwork*, which will help you push your project across the finish line.
>	- By working together in the planning phase, individuals assigned to the project can become a *strong team* by *the time the planning is done* and the work is about to start.

>[!quote]
>**Project plans** are critical because they are used to *capture* the *scope and time* it takes to complete a project. 
>- The project plan is essentially the *project’s blueprint*—it lays out all of the activities and milestones that your team needs to achieve in order to successfully complete the project. 
>- Project plans come in various shapes, sizes, and forms. 
>- Depending on the project you are managing, the template you use may vary, and some companies even have standard templates they require their project managers to use.

>	- Create *Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)*
>- Give yourself time to plan
>	- Planning is a time-intensive project.
>	- Use *effort estimation* and *capacity planning* to estimate realistically how long the project would take
>	- It is important to allow for *buffer time*,
>- Recognize and plan for the **inevitable**: 
>	- *things will go wrong*
>	- can't plan for every problem
>	- the team can identify the risks would likely to occur, and create time to mitigate possible issues
