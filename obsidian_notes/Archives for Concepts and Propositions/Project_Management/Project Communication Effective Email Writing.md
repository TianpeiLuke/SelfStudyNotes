### State what you want clearly

>[!info]
>Before composing an email, think about **what you want**, **when** you need *what* you want, and the **best way** to get what you want when you want it. 

>[!important]
> Here are some tips on how to clearly state what you want in your email:
> 
> - Include your **request** in the **subject** line of your email.
>     
> - State your **request** within the **first two paragraphs** of your email message.
>     
> - Indicate the **specific call-to-action** associated with your request (for example, reply, review, RSVP).
>     
> - Write **clear**, **concise** sentences when providing *details*.
>     
> - **Define terms**. 
> 	- **Avoid** using **acronyms** and **terminology** that users may not know. 
> 	- Provide additional information as necessary to *avoid misunderstanding*.

### Keep the content concise

>[!important]
>Make your words work for you. **Remove** any *writing that doesn’t help* to define *what you want* or *contribute* to your *reader's needs*.
> 
> - **Summarize** the content you want to convey, and **remove** anything in your email that *doesn’t contribute* to your goal.
>     
> - Aim to write “**question-less**” and “**self-standing**” emails. 
> 	- This means that the message contains enough information to *stand on its own*. 
> 	- The reader shouldn’t have any questions about **what you want** and **when** you want it.
>     
> - **Know your audience**. 
> 	- Some people—such as executives and other busy leadership—*may not want to read emails* of more than a few sentences or click on external links for further information. 
> 	- Try to tailor your emails accordingly.


### Structure your writing

>[!important]
>**Structure** has to do with the *visual flow*, or aesthetics, of your email. A well-structured email *conveys critical information to the reader quickly* and allows them to scan the explanatory text—or ignore it altogether. Here are some tips for effectively structuring your email:
> 
> - **Use bullets**. 
> 	- Bullets break up the visual flow. 
> 	- If you have more than one of something, consider using bullets. 
> 	- Write *strong action verbs* at the start of each bullet.
>     
> - **Use labels**. 
> 	- Labels help guide the reader to what information is *most important*. 
>     
> - **Add hyperlinks**. 
> 	- Hyperlinks allow readers to directly access *additional information*, rather than adding lengthy details to your email.
>     
> - **Write a strong topic sentence**. 
> 	- Place the *main idea* of the paragraph in the *topic sentence*.
> 

### Check grammar, punctuation, and spelling

>[!important]
>**Grammar**, **punctuation**, and **spelling** are *critical*. 
>
>- Turning grammar and spelling suggestions on in your email application can help you quickly identify errors. 
>- Be sure to *correct any errors* **before** sending off.

### Email Writing Best Practice

>[!important]
>Email Writing Best Practice
>- Carefully select **who** you're *sending* an email *to*, and **why**
>-  Make sure the **subject field** clearly states what the email is about.
>- Keep messages **short**  and **stay on topic**.
>- Attach and link *large amounts* of information **separately**
>- Clearly state **action items**
>- Use **correct grammar** and **spelling**
>- Write in appropriate **tone**
