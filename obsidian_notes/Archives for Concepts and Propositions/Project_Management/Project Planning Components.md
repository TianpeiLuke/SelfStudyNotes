## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Planning Components

>[!important] Definition
>The **project plan** consists of five basic elements
>- **tasks**: 
>	- assigned to different members of the team according to their *roles* and *skills*
>- **milestones**
>	- important points within the schedule that indicate progress.
>- **people**
>	- including people working on your team and their roles
>	- create personal responsibilities
>- **documentation**
>	- project plan is good places to link to important documentation
>	- e.g. *RACI chars*
>	- *project charters*
>	- budget
>	- risk management plan
>- **time**
>	- the estimated time that will be spent on the project.
>	- This forms the **basis** of the schedule, which is the *anchor* of your project plan.
>	- dates on which *tasks* should be *started* and *completed*
>	- dates when you hope to *reach various milestones*.
>	- the start and end dates of the *project*
>		- determine which resources need and when need them

### How project plan components are connected

>[!important]
>In addition to the schedule, you should also include the following components in your project plan: 
> 
> - **Scope** and **goals**
> 	- Both of them are in your **project charter**, which should be linked to the **project plan**
> 		- remind your team of the *objectives*
> 		- verify if the request *goes beyond* what was *initially agreed* upon in order to achieve those objectives.
>     
> - **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
> 	- a **Work Breakdown Structure** breaks the work down into more *manageable pieces*
> 	- In your project plan, the *tasks* should be *visible in one place* with *clear descriptions*, *owners*, and *due dates*.
> 	- project plan should also contain *detailed milestones* and *statuses* related to these tasks, which will help you and your team members *visualize project progress*.
>     
> - **Budget** 
> 	- The **project budget** is often linked to the project plan because it is *heavily dependent* on *key elements* of the project.
> 	- linking budgets allows for *smoother management* and *visibility*.
> 	- If someone in another department is managing the budget, make sure to have *regular check-ins* with them to ensure that you are aware of how you are tracking.
>     
> - **Management plans**
> 	- e.g. 
> 		- change management plan, 
> 		- risk management plan, 
> 		- communication plan
