## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Fishbone Diagram for Root Cause Identification and Risk Management

![[Project Planning Risk Management#^81f863]]

![[Project Planning Risk Management#^eabecc]]

>[!important] Definition
>**Fishbone diagrams** or **Ishikawa diagrams** or **cause-and-effect diagrams** are a visual way to look at *cause and effect*. 
>- It shows the possible causes of an event or risk.
>- They are called **fishbone diagrams** because they have a similar shape to a fish skeleton.
>- They are very useful at risk management.
>- They were developed by Japanese organizational theorist Kaoru Ishikawa in the 1960s to measure quality control processes in the shipbuilding industry.

>[!important] Definition
>A **risk register** is a table or chart that contains your list of risks.

>[!important] Definition
>A **root cause** is the initial cause of a situation that introduces a problem or risk.

>[!info]
>The **purpose** of using fishbone diagrams in risk management is to **identify the root cause** of a potential problem for a project or program.

>[!important] Definition
>The steps to *create a fishbone diagram* are:
> 
> - **Define the problem**
>     
> - **Identify the categories**
>     
> - **Brainstorm the causes**
>     
> - **Analyze the causes**

### Step 1) Define the problem

>[!info]
>adds the problem to the head of his fishbone diagram.

### Step 2) Identify the categories

>[!info]
>In this step,  thinks of the **types of categories** that could be causing the problem. 
>- These categories will change depending on the type of problem or industry. Some common examples of categories include “people,” “technology,” “materials,” “transportation,” “money,” “time,” “environment,” and “procedures.”

### Step 3) Brainstorm the causes

>[!info]
>*brainstorms areas of concern* within each category. 
>- reaches out to the team for help in identifying these possible causes. 
>- Then,  *fills in the lists* with some of the **causes** that could be related to each category.

>[!quote]
>**Pro tip:** Brainstorming should be a **judgment-free zone**. 
>- Encourage the flow of information related to the categories and try not to rule things out. When dealing with human factors, steer clear of naming individuals; instead, focus solely on behaviors.

### Step 4) Analyze the causes

>[!info]
>analyzes those causes. 
>- He needs to identify the root cause of the existing problem so he can figure out how to mitigate it for the current project.
>- Note that _one_ cause of a problem isn’t necessarily the _root cause_.


>[!quote]
>**Pro tip**: Fishbone diagrams are tools that can be useful *during any phase* of the project.
> - When you use them in *risk planning*, you are trying to identify the possible causes of a problem that *may or may not occur*. 
> - When you use them in the *execution phase*, you are trying to *find the root cause* of an issue that has *already occurred*.
