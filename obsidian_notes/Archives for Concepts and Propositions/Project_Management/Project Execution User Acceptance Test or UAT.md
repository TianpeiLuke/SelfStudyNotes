## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Execution User Acceptance Test or UAT

>[!important] Definition
>**User acceptance testing (UAT)** is testing that helps a business make sure that a product, service, or process works for its users.
>- A UAT must meet the *agreed upon requirements* and deliver the *expected results*.
>- A UAT is also called a **beta test.**

- [[Project Communication]]

### The goals of UAT

>[!important]
>The *main objectives* of UAT are to:
> 
> - Demonstrate that the product, service, or process is behaving in *expected ways* in *real-world scenarios*. 
>     
> - Show that the product, service, or process is *working as intended*.
>     
> - *Identify issues* that need to be addressed before project completion.

### Best practices for effective UAT

>[!important]
>These best practices can help you administer effective UAT:
>- *Define* and *write down* your **acceptance criteria**.
>	- **Acceptance criteria** are pre-established standards or requirements that a product, service, or process must meet. 
>	- Write down these requirements for each item that you intend to test.
>- *Create* the **test cases** for *each item* that you are testing.
>	- A **test case** is a sequence of steps and its expected results. 
>	- It usually consists of a series of actions that the user can perform to find out if the product, service, or process behaved the way it was supposed to.
>- **Select your users carefully**.
>	- It is important to choose users who will actually be the end users of the product, service, or process.
>- Write the UAT scripts based on **user stories**.
>	- A **user story** is an informal, general explanation of a feature written from the perspective of the end user.
>	- UAT scripts will be delivered to the users during the testing process.
>- **Communicate** with users and let them know *what to expect*.
>	- If you can prepare users ahead of time, there will be fewer questions, issues, or delays during the testing process.
>- *Prepare* the **testing environment** for UAT.
>	- Ensure that the users have proper credentials and access, and try out these credentials ahead of time to ensure they work.
>- Provide a **step-by-step plan** to help **guide users** through the testing process.
>	- It will be helpful for users to have some *clear, easy-to-follow instructions* that will help focus their attention on the right places. 
>	- You can create this plan in a digital document or spreadsheet and share with them ahead of time.
>	- This step is called the **critical user journey.**
>- Compile *notes* in a **single document** and **record any issues** that are discovered.
>	- You can create a digital spreadsheet or document that corresponds to your plan. 
>	- It can have designated areas to track issues for each item that is tested, including the users’ opinions on the severity of each issue. 
>	- This will help you prioritize fixes.

### Managing UAT feedback

>[!info]
>Users provide feedback after performing UAT. This feedback might include positive comments, bug reports, and change requests. 

>[!important]
>As the project manager, you can address the different types of feedback as follows:
> 
> - **Bugs or issues:** 
> 	- Users might report technical issues, also known as **bugs**, or other types of issues after performing UAT. 
> 	- You can track and monitor these issues in a spreadsheet or equivalent system and prioritize which issues to fix. 
> 	- For instance, *critical issues*, such as not being able to access, download, or search the employee handbook, need to be *prioritized* over non-critical issues, such as feedback on the cover art of the handbook. 
>     
> - **Change requests:** 
> 	- Sometimes the user might suggest *minor changes* to the product, service, or process after UAT. 
> 	- These types of requests or changes should also be managed and *prioritized*. 
> 	- Depending on the type and volume of the requests, you may want to *share* this data with your *primary stakeholders*, and you may also need to *adjust your project timeline* to implement these new requests.



## Explanation

>[!info]
>A user acceptance test is incredibly important because it takes place *near the end* of a product's development, and therefore, is an *overall user experience test* of the *entire* product, software, or service.

- [[Project Launch and Project Landing]]

>[!quote]
>- UAT simulates real-world conditions, so when the feature works as intended during the testing process, you can be more confident that your product, service, or process will work properly once it is launched. 
>- It allows a project team to gather detailed information about how users *interact* with a product, service, or process. 
>- UAT helps the team answer such questions as: 
>	- Do users recognize its purpose and uses? 
>	- How do they interact with it? 
>	- How much time do users take to interact with it? 
>	- Do they notice all of its features? 
>	- Is the product, service, or process accessible to everyone? 
>- UAT also allows the project team to record information about how users feel about their experience with a product, service, or process. 
>	- Through testing, the team can learn about the emotions it evokes, identities it conveys, appeal it holds, and so on.
