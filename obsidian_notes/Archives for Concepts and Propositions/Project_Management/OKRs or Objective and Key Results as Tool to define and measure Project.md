![[SMART or Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-bound Goals#^105083]]


>[!important] Definition
>**Objective and Key Result (OKR)** is a tool that combines a *goal* and a *metric* to determine a measurable outcome.
>- **O** stands for **Objective** 
>	- It defines *what* needs to be achieved.
>	- It describes the *desired result* or *outcome*.
>- **KR** stands for **Key Results**.
>	- These are the *measurable outcomes* that define when the objective has been met.
>	- Key results should be a little more *ambitious*
>	- Set a stretch goal to challenge ourselves

### Communicating and Tracking OKRs

>[!quote]
>Conducting *regular check-ins* and actively *tracking progress* with your team can help ensure that objectives are being met and that any issues are resolved as soon as possible.
> 
>- **Share your OKRs with your team.** Once you’ve created OKRs for your project, it’s important to communicate them to your team so that everyone knows how to focus and align their efforts. 
>	- You can do this by *sharing* a digital document, presenting them in a meeting, or adding them to an internal website. 
>	- OKRs can help your project team *stick to its goals*, monitor which are falling short, and be continuously motivated to meet project objectives. 
> 
>- **Assign owners.** Assign an owner to every key result so that everybody knows who’s responsible for what. This helps add clarity and increases accountability.

### Measuring Progress

>[!quote]
>Measuring your OKRs is an important part of tracking and sharing your progress. One shortcut to determining the status of a project is to score or grade your OKRs. 
> 
> - **Determine how you will score your OKRs.**
> 	- The simplest approach to scoring OKRs is the *“yes/no” method*, with “yes” meaning you achieved your objective and “no” meaning you didn’t.
> 	- A more advanced scoring approach is to grade your key results on a *scale*.
> - **Set your scoring expectations.** 
> 	- With Google’s 0.0–1.0 scale, the expectation is to set ambitious OKRs and aim to achieve an average of at least 0.6 to 0.7 across all OKRs.
> 	- For OKRs graded according to percentage achieved, the sweet spot is somewhere in the 60–70% range
> - **Schedule checkpoints.** It’s important to regularly communicate the status of project OKRs with your team and senior managers.



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>One way to think about **OKRs** is that they *separate* the different *components* of SMART goals and *clarify* them even further, rather than grouping everything into one statement.
