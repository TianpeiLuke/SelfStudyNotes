### Project Charter

>[!important] Definition
>A **project charter** is a formal document that *define the project* and its *goals* and *outline what is needed* to accomplish them.
>- A project charter allows you to 
>	- *get organized*, 
>	- set up a *framework* for what needs to be done 
>	- and *communicate* those details to others.
>- Project charter should make it clear that 
>	- the *benefits* **outweigh** the *costs* of the project.
>- Draft the project charter and *review with stakeholder*.
>- Get *approval* from stakeholder to move on to the next phase.
>	- management is *supportive*,
>	- it's also a key step to ensure that the project *matches* the needs of the organization
>	- After approval, you have the *authority* to move forward with the project.
>- Need *review* and *refine* the project charter *throughout* the project lifecycle.

> You will likely use many different project charter formats throughout your project management career. 
> - One example is a condensed, simplified document, like the one you'll learn about in the upcoming video and the one linked in the activities. 
> - A short and simple project charter can be used on smaller projects that are not very complex.
>   
>Your organization may have a **unique template** for you to use, or you may have the flexibility to leverage one you come across in your career. 
>
>As your project progresses, you may also encounter revisions to your project charter—and that is okay. 
>- Remember, it is a **living document**; 
>	- let it grow with your project, and **review and revisit it often** to ensure you are aligned.
