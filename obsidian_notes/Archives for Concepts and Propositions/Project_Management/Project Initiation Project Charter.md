### Project Charter

>[!important] Definition
>A **project charter** is a document that contains all the details of the project. 
>- Project charters clearly *define the project* and its *goals* and *outline what is needed* to accomplish them.
>- A project charter allows you to *get organized*, set up a *framework* for what needs to be done and *communicate* those details to others.
>- Draft the project charter and *review with stakeholder*.
>- Get *approval* from stakeholder to move on to the next phase.

>As you wrap up the initiation phase, your focus will shift to internal operations. Youâ€™ll create a project charter to guide your team as they *plan* training, fulfillment, and delivery procedures
