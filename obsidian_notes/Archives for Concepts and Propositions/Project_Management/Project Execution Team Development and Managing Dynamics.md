### Five Stages of Team Development

>[!important] Definition
>Bruce Tuckman's *five stages* of **team development**.
>- **Forming**
>	- Team gets to know each other
>	- *Project manager* should **clarify** 
>		- project goals, 
>		- roles, 
>		- and context about the project.
>	- People are seeking guidance and it's your job to *provide that guidance*.
>- **Storming** 
>	- As people settle into their roles and the work on their project begins, the people on your team are *interacting more* and maybe *disagreeing a bit*.
>	- *Frustrations* merge
>	- *Project manager* should focus on **conflict resolution**. 
>		- *Listen* as the team addresses problems to solve and 
>		- *share* insights on how the team might better function as a unit.
>- **Norming**
>	- *Conflict* is mostly *resolved* and team is working together
>	- *Project manager* should **codify the team norms**, ensuring that the team is *aware* of those norms and *reinforce* them when needed.
>- **Performing** 
>	- Team works together *seamlessly*
>	- *Project manager* should focus on 
>		- **delegating**, 
>		- **motivating** 
>		- and providing **feedback** to keep up the team's momentum.
>- **Adjourning**
>	- Team disband and Project closure
>	- Celebration
