>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Planning Realistic Time Estimate

>[!important] Definition
>**Time estimation** is a prediction of the total amount of time required to complete a task.

>[!info]
>Effort estimation differs from time estimation in that 
>- **effort** quantifies the amount of time it will take a person to *complete work* on a task.
>- On the flip side, **time** refers to the *overall duration* of the task from start to finish. 
>	- That includes *inactive time*.
>	  

>[!info]
>If there's idle time baked into a given task, your teammate is effectively free to do other things.

>[!info]
>An **unrealistic effort estimate** can *negatively impact* a project schedule.
>- Generally, this happens when you **underestimate** the amount of time it will take to *complete* a task.
>- Often, the culprit for under estimating effort is **optimism**.
>- **Too much optimism** can lead you to *overlook potential risks* that could set your plans behind schedule.

### Communication with Teammates

>[!info]
>**Your teammates** will have the *most realistic understanding* of the amount of work required to complete a task and should be able to provide you with the *best estimate*.

>[!important]
>**Asking the teammate** assigned to the task for their estimate is likely to yield a more accurate estimation since they'll have a *deeper understanding* of the work and the nuances of what's required to complete the task.

### Buffers

>[!important] Definition
>A **buffer** is *extra time* added to the end of a task or a project to account for *unexpected slowdowns or delays* in work progress.
>-  Buffers are important because they can provide some **leeway**, just in case
>- With a buffer, you can *add extra time* into your schedule, and our project shouldn't fall off track when task delays inevitably arise.

>[!important] Definition
>Two type of **buffers**:
>- **Task buffers** 
>	- refer to *extra time* tacked on to a *specific task*.
>	- Task buffers should be used primarily for tasks that are *out of the project team's control*.
>	- should be used *more sparingly* for tasks within the project team's control.
>	- Adding a buffer to every task could *lengthen your project schedule unnecessarily*
>- **project buffers**
>	- project buffers provide extra time to the *overall project schedule*
>	- you can use that extra time, two to three days, for example, as needed throughout the project

### Overcoming the planning fallacy

![[Planning Fallacy#^d20547]]

>[!quote]
>As a project manager, you should aim to **balance** being *aware of* the **planning fallacy** with keeping an **optimistic attitude** about the project, even as things change. 
>- **Be optimistically realistic**: 
>	- Push for the best outcomes while planning for the proper time it may take to accomplish each task.

>[!quote]
>Being on the *lookout for* “**what-ifs**” is a key project management skill. 
>- Considering situations that *could affect* whether or not the project is completed *on time* can help you overcome the planning fallacy. 
>- Also, you will always have a project team in your corner, so make sure you *use them as resources* to help uncover possible risks. 
>- Remember to be “**optimistically realistic**” and push for the best outcome while still planning for the proper time to accomplish each task.

### Use Soft Skills to Gather Information

>[!important] Definition
>**Soft skills** are *personal characteristics* that help people work effectively with others.
>
>These include 
>- **crucial communication** 
>- and **interpersonal skills**

>[!important]
>There are three ways to use *soft skills* and *gather accurate estimates* from your teammates
>- **Asking the right questions**
>	- asking effective, *open-ended questions* about their assigned tasks
>	- An **open-ended question** is a question that cannot be answered with a yes or a no.
>- **Negotiating effectively**,
>	- it's possible that people on your project team have *competing priorities* on other teams to keep track of
>	- *Win-win solution*: 
>		- Create a sense of *shared ownership* over the project outcomes and create a schedule that aligns with everyone's workload.
>- **Practicing empathy**.
>	-  **Empathy** refers to a person's ability to *relate to the thoughts and feelings* of others.
>	- avoid assigning tasks when teammates are unable to complete them on time.
>	- avoid overloading 
>	- remembering to always be **appreciative** of the work, collaboration, and support that you're getting from the team.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Carefully performing key steps of your planning process, such as **time estimation**, can have a big impact on the success of your project. 
>
>Conversely, flawed time estimation is the root cause of many failed projects. That means many projects fail because project managers and teams fail to accurately estimate the time that it will take to complete tasks.

### Run fast, pay later

>[!info]
>How to prevent failure in time estimation?
>
>- **Escalating concerns**
>	- slowing down and planning the project thoroughly  instead of moving faster towards the goal.
>- **Working carefully**
>	- Thorough and careful planning with  team could have helped to identify problems and solutions in advance, such as:
>		- **Elimination of tasks**. It is possible that all of the tasks initially listed didn’t need to be completed. There may have been unnecessary work added in, and the team could have completed the project without it
>		- **Increased team size**. addressed the potential schedule risk by requesting more resources early on in the project rather than trying to execute without the necessary resources.
>		- **Streamlining of activities**. There may have been some tasks that could have been done in parallel, or at least not in sequential order.
>- **Gathering input from the team**
>	- bring together team members, peers, and management to help build and review the project plan
>	- take action to address the concerns of the team members who were responsible for completing the tasks within the estimated time.

>[!quote]
>Be **realistic** when estimating time and effort for a project. 
>- Take the time to carefully **evaluate potential risks and the impact** on the work,  
>- **Talk to your team** members about these challenges. 
>- Don’t be afraid to **escalate** potential concerns to management. Optimism is a trait of a great project manager and leader, but it can adversely affect your projects when it comes to time estimation.
