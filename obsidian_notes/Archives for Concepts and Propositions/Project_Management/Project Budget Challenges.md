### Challenge 1: Budget pre-allocation

>[!important] Definition
>You may encounter situations where your budget is *already set* before you even start the project. 
>
>This is known as **budget pre-allocation**.

>If you are given a pre-allocated budget, it is important to work with your customer to **set expectations** on *scope and deliverables* within the allocated budget. 
>- To deliver a great product within your allocated budget will require detailed planning.

>[!important]
>A pre-allocated budget should also be **routinely monitored** to ensure the amounts you have budgeted are *sufficient* to meet your costs. 
>- Be sure to carefully *track all expenses* in your budget. 
>- *Regularly match* these expenses against your pre-allocated budget to ensure you have sufficient funds for the remainder of your project.
>  
>Part of that planning includes making sure that you are tracking fixed and time- and materials-based expenses. 
>- **Fixed contracts** are usually paid for when certain milestones are reached. 
>- **Time and materials contracts** are usually paid for monthly, based on the hours worked and other fees associated with the work, such as travel and meal expenses.  

### Challenge 2: Inaccurately calculating TCO

>[!important] Definition
>Another budgeting pitfall you should try to avoid is *underestimating* the **total cost of ownership (TCO)** for project resources. 
>- TCO takes into account *multiple elements* that contribute to the cost of an item. 
>- It factors in the expenses associated with a product or service *over its lifetime*, rather than just *upfront costs*.

### Challenge 3: Scope creep

>[!important] Definition
>**Scope creep** is when changes, growth, and other factors affect the project’s *scope* at any point *after* the project begins. 
>- Scope creep causes *additional work* that wasn’t planned for, so scope creep can also impact your budget.

>[!important]
There are **several factors** that can lead to scope creep, such as: 
> 
> - A vague **Statement of Work (SoW)**
>     
> - Conversations and agreements about the project that aren’t officially **documented**
>     
> - Unattainable **timeframes** and **deadlines**
>     
> - **Last-minute asks** from priority stakeholders
>     
> 
> Addressing these factors as you plan your project can help prevent scope creep from impacting your budget.
