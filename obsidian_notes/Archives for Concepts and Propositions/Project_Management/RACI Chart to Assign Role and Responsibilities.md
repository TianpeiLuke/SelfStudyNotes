## Explanation

>[!quote]
>One thing that will always remain constant is there will never be more than one person designated as "accountable."
>- This prevents confusion, because having one person accountable clearly defines **ownership**.
>- However, the same person that is "accountable" may also be "responsible."
>- There are several other factors that can cause *role confusion*.
>	- For example, there might be unbalanced workloads, which means some people might be doing more work or less work than others on the team.
>	- Or there could be an unclear hierarchy when people aren't sure who to seek help from if a task doesn't get done
>	- or unclear ownership of decisions where people aren't sure who makes the final call on a project

>[!quote]
>Another issue could be **overlapping work**.
>- This is when teams or individuals feel that they're responsible for the same work.
>- When this happens, things can get confusing fast.
