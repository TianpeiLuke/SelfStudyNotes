## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: RACI Chart to Assign Role and Responsibilities

![[Project Initiation Defining Project Roles#^41ce0d]]


>[!important] Definition
>A **RACI chart** helps to define *roles* and *responsibilities* for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently.

>[!important] Definition
>There are *four types of participation* included in a **RACI chart**.
>- Over your career, you may hear a RACI chart referred to as a 
>	- **Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)**, 
>	- **RACI diagram**, 
>	- or **RACI matrix**.
>
>These are: 
>- **responsible**:
>	- who gets the work done
>	- Individuals who are assigned the “responsible” role for a task are the ones who are actually doing the work to complete the task. 
>	- Every task needs *at least one responsible party*. 
>		- It’s a best practice to try to limit the number of team members assigned to a task’s  responsible role, but in some cases, you may have more than one.
>- **accountable**:
>	- who makes sure the work is done
>	- The “accountable” person is responsible for making sure the task gets done. 
>	- It is important to have *only one individual accountable* for each task. 
>	- This helps clarify **ownership** of the task. 
>	- The accountable person ultimately has the *authority* to *approve* the deliverable of the responsible party.
>- **consulted**
>	- who gives input or *feedback* on work
>	- e.g. **subject matter expert (SME)**
>	- Team members or stakeholders who are placed in the “consulted” role have *useful information to help* complete the task. 
>	- There is no maximum or minimum number of people who can be assigned a “consulted” role, 
>	- but it’s important that *each person has a reason for being there*.
>- and **informed**
>	- who needs to know the outcome
>	- Individuals who are identified as needing to be “informed” *need to know* the *final decisions* that were made and when a task is *completed*. 
>	- It is common to have many people assigned to this category and for some team members to be informed on most tasks. 
>	- Team members or stakeholders here will *not be asked for feedback*, so it is key to make sure people who are in this group only *require status updates* and do not need to provide any direct feedback for the completion of the effort.

>[!info] Pro Tip:
>Pro-tip: use **roles** rather than *names* if some people might take on more than one role.

### Responsible

>[!quote]
>A couple of questions to ask yourself when determining which person or people should be placed in the **responsible role** for a given task are:
> 
> - What department does the work fall under?
>     
> - Who will perform the work?
>     
> 
> It is helpful to evaluate the people on your team to determine the role that suits them. Remember that you may need to *list roles rather than names*, if some people take on more than one role.

### Accountable

>[!quote]
> In order to determine who should be tagged as the **accountable team** member, consider:
> 
> - Who will delegate the task to be completed?
>     
> - Who will review the work to determine if the task is complete?
>     
> 
> You may encounter a situation where the *responsible party is also accountable*, but where possible, it is helpful to *separate these roles*. 
> 
> Ensuring that **accountability is not shared** ensures that there is no confusion on who the *ownership* belongs to.


### Consulted

>[!quote] 
> Here are a few ways you can help identify who is appropriate for the role:
> 
> - Who will the task *impact*?
>     
> - Who will have *input or feedback* for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
>     
> - Who are the *subject matter experts (SMEs)* for the task?
>     
> 
>The consulted people will be in *frequent, two-way communication* with the responsible party, so it is key to make sure that the right people are in this role to help accomplish the task efficiently and correctly.


### Informed

>[!quote]





## Explanation

>[!quote]
>One thing that will always remain constant is there will never be more than one person designated as "accountable."
>- This prevents confusion, because having one person accountable clearly defines **ownership**.
>- However, the same person that is "accountable" may also be "responsible."
>- There are several other factors that can cause *role confusion*.
>	- For example, there might be unbalanced workloads, which means some people might be doing more work or less work than others on the team.
>	- Or there could be an unclear hierarchy when people aren't sure who to seek help from if a task doesn't get done
>	- or unclear ownership of decisions where people aren't sure who makes the final call on a project

>[!quote]
>Another issue could be **overlapping work**.
>- This is when teams or individuals feel that they're responsible for the same work.
>- When this happens, things can get confusing fast.
