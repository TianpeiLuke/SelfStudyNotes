>[!important]
>Escalation is great for preventing two common issues within a project:
>- **Trench wars** 
>	- Trench wars occur when two peers or groups *can't* seem to come to an *agreement*, and *neither* party is willing to *give in*.
>- **Bad compromises**
>	- A bad compromise occurs when two parties settle on a so-called *solution*, but the *end product still suffers*.




## Explanation

>[!important]
>A project manager should **escalate** an issue at the *first sign* of **critical problems** in the project.
>- **Critical problems** are e.g.
>	- issues that may cause a *delay* to a major *project milestone*, 
>	- issues that cause *budget overruns*, 
>	- issues that can result in the *loss of a customer*, 
>	- and issues that *push back* the estimated *project completion date*.
