## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Closure Closing Process

>[!info] 
> In order to close a project, you must ensure that:
> 
> - All work is *done*.
>     
> - All *agreed-upon* project management *processes* have been *executed*.
>     
> - You have received *formal recognition and agreement* from key stakeholders that the project is done.

### Avoiding the impact of project closure oversights

>[!important]
>*Oversights or skipping* steps in the **closing phase** of a project can:
> 
> - Impact the product’s or service’s *scheduled launch dates*.
>     
> - Put your organization at *legal risk*.
>     
> - Result in significant *financial losses* to your organization.
>     
> - Undermine your team's *credibility*, and yours.
>     
> - Damage your *relationship* with the customer or client.
>     


>[!quote]
> **All** of the steps of the project life cycle—initiating the project, making a plan, executing and completing tasks, and closing the project—are **essential** for a successful outcome. 
> 
> Unfortunately, closing the project is a phase that too often gets skipped, which can negatively impact both the project manager and their organization. 
> - To avoid these issues, make sure to plan for this phase just as you would any of the other project life cycle phases.
