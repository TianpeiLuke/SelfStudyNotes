### Closing Process for Clients and Stakeholders

>[!info]
>Decide if your project warrants
>-  a *small closing process* at the *end of each milestone* or a *formal 
>- and more *comprehensive closing phase* near the *very end*.


>[!important] 
>If you decide to conduct closing processes after *each phase or milestone*:
>- **Put together closing documentation**
>	- Compile your closeout report and add the notes from your recent team retrospective. 
>	- Together, these documents represent the consensus of your team regarding what went well and what needs improvement.
> 
>- **Refer to prior documentation**
>	- Revisit the *statement of work* for the scene, as well as the *risk register* and the *project plan*. 
>	- Check that your team completed each of their assigned tasks, and that you delivered on all of the required work.
> 
>- **Make sure all stakeholders are aware that this phase is ending**
>	- Compose an email to all stakeholders to let them know you’re finished with the scene. 
>	- As a bonus, you can include a 30-second clip to preview the deliverable.
> 
>- **Conduct administrative closure of the procurement process**
>	- The scene required some specialized vendors and it’s time to close out their contracts and pay them. 
>	- It’s also time to *return props* that were on loan from a science fiction museum.
>-  **Complete any necessary follow-up work**
>	- Ensure that your team follows up on the action items that you established during your *retrospective*. 
>	- Follow up with your outside vendors to uncover any final pieces of feedback about the project phase.

>If you decide to conduct a *comprehensive closing phase* near the *very end* of project.

>- **Ensure that the project has satisfied its goals and desired outcomes**
>	- Review the project to make sure that all tasks and deliverables were completed and nothing is missing.
>- **Document acceptance from all stakeholders like clients and sponsors**
>	- Ensuring that you have written proof that stakeholders are happy with the deliverables and outcomes is very important.
>- **Review all contracts and documentation with your project team**
>	- This includes things like 
>		- your SOW, 
>		- RFP, 
>		- RACI chart,

>As a project manager, you want to build a *culture* within your team and company to aim for *constant improvements*.
>- This means that you'll need to *solicit feedback* that will help you to do better in your next project.
>	- This feedback might touch on any aspect of the project, from planning, scheduling, execution, communication, or team dynamics.
>	- You might receive feedback about processes you led, and that's okay.
>
>*Working through feedback* is crucial to your growth as a project manager.

>[!quote]
>Part of encouraging continuous growth is to recognize and celebrate a job well done.
>- The way you *celebrate* will change depending on where you're at in the project and what feels most appropriate to your team.
>
>Taking a moment to *reward* yourself with a token of appreciation turns the celebration into a team-building exercise.
