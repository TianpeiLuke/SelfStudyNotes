### Why?

>[!important]
>Why is it important to set **milestones**?
>
>- a clear **understanding** of the **amount of work** your project will *require*.
>	- The act of setting milestones forces you to *break* your project down into more *manageable chunks*.
>	- help you better *manage the project workload*
>- keep your project **on track**
>	- assign *deadeline* for each milestone
>	- verify if the project is in the *right pace* by checking the *deadlines*
>- uncover areas where you might need to **adjust** scope, timelines, or resources to meet your goals.
>- reaching milestones can seriously **motivate** your team and illustrate **real progress** to your stakeholders.
>	- create a moment of *celebration* for the team.
>- serve as a great **check-in point** to *highlight your progress* to stakeholders.
>	- stakeholders can see *everything is on track* and up to their *standards*

>[!quote]
>It's also important to remember that milestones must be **completed on time** and **in sequential order**
>- If the team *misses* the mark to *complete a deliverable* tied to a specific milestone, it could *set back* your *project schedule*, meaning your team might need to work overtime or add additional resources to catch up

### Set tasks to identify milestones

>[!important]  
> Setting tasks can help you clearly define milestones. You can do this in two ways:
> 
> 1. **Top-down scheduling:** In this approach, the project manager lays out the *higher-level milestones*, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The project manager works with their team to ensure that all tasks are captured.
>     
> 2. **Bottom-up scheduling:** In this approach, the project manager looks at all of the *individual tasks* that need to be completed and then rolls those tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone.

### Identifying Milestones

>[!important]
>**Setting milestones** is to evaluate your project *as a whole*:
>-  refer to *project charter* for the *project goals*
>-  make a *list of tasks* need to achieve the goal
>	-  **milestones** are the *big items* that indicates *progress*
>	- smaller items that stakeholders need not review are **project tasks**

- [[Project Initiation Project Charter]]

### Assigning Deadlines

>[!quote]
>Once you've determined your milestones, the next step is to **assign each one a deadline**.
>- Reaching each of your milestones is dependent on the *completion of multiple project tasks*. 
>	- So to make sure you give your team a fair *amount of time* to complete each of those tasks, you'll need to **space your milestones out** accordingly.
>- you can *connect* with teammates to discuss the tasks required to reach each milestone and *get their estimates* for how long these tasks will take.
>- you will also want to consider the *needs of your stakeholders*.


## Explanation

### Integrate milestones into your project schedule

>[!quote] 
> There is *not a consistent number* of milestones in every project. 
> - Some projects will have a few milestones, while others may have dozens. 
> 
> 
>Rather than aiming to hit a certain number of milestones, try to set **milestones** for **the most important events** in your project. 
> - *Review* your project schedule and *identify important moments* or checkpoints. 
> - In other words, pinpoint where in your project you will *achieve major goals* and make those points your milestones.

### Milestone-setting pitfalls

>[!quote] 
> Here are some things to avoid when setting milestones: 
> 
> - **Don’t set too many milestones**. When there are too many milestones, their importance is downplayed. And, if milestones are too small or too specific, you may end up with too many, making the project look much bigger than it really is to your team and stakeholders.  
>     
> - **Don’t mistake tasks for milestones**. Remember that milestones should represent moments in time, and in order to map out how you will get to those moments, you need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone.
>     
> - **Don’t list your milestones and tasks separately.** Make sure that tasks and milestones can be *visualized together in one place*, such as a project plan. This will help ensure that you are hitting your deadlines and milestones.
