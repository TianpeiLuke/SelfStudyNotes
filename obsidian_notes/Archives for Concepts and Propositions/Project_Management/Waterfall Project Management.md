## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Waterfall Project Management

>[!important] Definition
>**Waterfall** is a popular project management methodology that refers to the *sequential or linear ordering* of phases.
>- You complete *one phase at a time*, *not* proceeding to the next *until* it is done.
>- Then you move down the line like a waterfall, starting at the top of the mountain and traveling to the bottom.

### Manage Requirement

>[!quote]
>In a Waterfall project, you'll probably need 
>- a **product requirements document**, which lists the scope and requirements of the project. 
>- You need to have several **formally approved project plans**, and you might have a team of people whose job it is just to write and approve these plans.
>- You might also set up a **change control board**â€”a formal and rigorous process to manage any changes to requirements.
>
>All this is designed to protect the team from building something that the client or stakeholders don't want and aims to minimize any changes that could lead to scope creep.
>
>**Formally-approved project plans** work well when the *desired end product* is **known** and **understood**.

### Manage Documentations

>[!quote]
>Waterfall projects use lots of documentation because 
>- there are *lots of __handoffs__* between *phases* and handoffs among *different teams* within the project.
>- Also, because the work is done in *bigger chunks*, you'll need to leave behind *more pieces of documentation* at each stage in the project

### Manage Deliverables

>[!quote]
>In Waterfall projects, you often don't release the deliverable **until the very end**.
>- The final product release feels like a big event, major announcement, lots of hoopla, and is often super fun and exciting.
