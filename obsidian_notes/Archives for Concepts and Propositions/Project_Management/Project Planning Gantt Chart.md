>[!important]
>Regardless of what tool you use, be sure to include this key information: 
> 
> - **Task ID numbers** or **task names**: 
> 	- You might end up with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of tasks in a project. Assigning a task ID or name makes it easy to find and reference a task when communicating with team members and stakeholders. 
>     
> - **Task durations:** 
> 	- A *task duration* is the amount of time you *estimate* that task should take. 
> 	- Adding task durations to your project plan helps you organize and prioritize the tasks in the project to help ensure you hit your goal on time. 
>     
> - **Start and finish dates:** 
> 	- Including start and finish dates for each task helps you track whether you are progressing on time or not. 
>     
> - **Who is responsible for what:** 
> 	- Including each team member’s *role and responsibilities* helps promote clarity and efficiency. 
> 	- As a best practice, *assign an owner to each task*, as well.
