## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Execution Data-Driven Improvement Frameworks

### DMAIC Framework

>[!important] Definition
>**DMAIC framework** is a data-driven improvement framework.
>
>It maps out five steps that you can take when working toward *continuous improvements*.
>- **Define**
>	- define 
>		- the *business problem*, 
>		- *goals*, 
>		- *resources*, 
>		- *project scope*, 
>		- and *project timeline*.
>- **Measure**
>	- conduct *performance metrics* and data collection to establish *baselines* and *measure success*.
>- **Analyze**
>	- Work to find the *root causes* of problems and understand their *impact*.
>- **Improvement**
>	- implementing a reasonable *solution* to the problem.
>- **Control**
>	- This is where you'll *implement* the changes and stay on top of *monitoring* the updated processes you've established.

### PDCA Framework

>[!important] Definition
>**PDCA** is a four-step process that focuses on identifying a problem, fixing that issue, assessing whether the fix was successful, and fine-tuning the final fix.
>- **Plan**
>	- *identify* the issue and *root cause* 
>	- *brainstorm solutions* to the problem
>- **Do**
>	- *fix* that issue
>- **Check**
>	- *compare* your results to the *goal* to find out if the problem is fixed.
>- **Act**
>	-  *fine-tune* the final fix to ensure continuous improvement.
