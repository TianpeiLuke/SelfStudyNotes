## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Execution Common Data Metrics

>[!important] Definition
>A **metric** is a quantifiable measurement that is used to track and assess a business objective.

- [[Project Initiation Measuring Success]]
- [[Project Execution Tracking]]
- [[Project Execution Tracking Method]]
- [[Project Execution Data-Informed Decision-Making]]
- [[Project Execution Data Analysis and Steps]]

### Productivity metrics

>[!important] Definition
>**Productivity metrics** typically *measure progress* and output over time. 
>- They allow you to *track*—or predict—the effectiveness and efficiency of your project team.


>[!example]
>Common **productivity metric** include
>- **Milestones**
>	- Milestones are important points within the project schedule that *indicate progress* 
>	- It often signify when a team completes a deliverable or phase of the project.
>- **Tasks**
>	- Project managers assign tasks to project team members for them to accomplish within a set period of time.
>- **Projection**
>	- This metric helps you analyze current information to *predict future* outcomes.
>- **Duration**
>	- A project’s *duration* is the total time it takes to complete a project from start to finish.

>[!info] 
>To track your team's productivity over time, analyze the **number of tasks or milestones completed** in a given time frame.

>[!info]
>**On-time completion rates** can help illustrate to clients and stakeholders how the project is progressing and when they can expect certain deliverables to be ready. 
>- If your project's completion rates are high, it means you're doing a good job of meeting your completion goals.

>[!info]
>Calculating **duration** (how long something takes) can be useful for setting and evaluating tasks and milestones and determining if you'll meet project deadlines. 
>- Tracking task duration can improve the accuracy of estimating a project's timeline.

>[!info]
>You can also analyze current information to predict future outcomes and make **projections** (or **forecasts**) about productivity trends, project durations, costs, performance or quality.


- [[Key Performance Indicator or KPI]]

### Quality Metrics

>[!important] Definition
>**Quality metrics** relate to *achieving acceptable outcomes*.
>- They can include metrics such as
>	- **number of changes**, and **number of issues**, 
>	- and **cost variance**, all of which affect quality.

>[!info]
>Track the *number of changes* and *issues* to identify patterns, refine processes, and share information about the project with stakeholders.

>[!important] Definition
>**Changes** refer to differences in any aspect of the project from what was originally planned or required.

- [[Project Execution Continuous Improvement]]
- [[Project Planning Risk Management]]

>[!important] Definition
>**Cost** or **budget variance** is the difference between the actual amount of money spent on a project and the amount that was budgeted for the project.
>- A high variance means you should *reevaluate your estimation process*. 
>- You could be *under- or over-estimating costs* for your budget, or you may not be tracking expenses effectively.

#### Happiness and satisfaction

>[!important] Definition
>**Happiness metrics** are metrics that relate to different aspects of the user's *overall satisfaction* with a product or service, 
>- like **visual appeal**, 
>- how likely they are to **recommend**, 
>- and **ease of use**.


>[!important] Definition
>**Customer satisfaction scores** reflect user **attitudes**, **satisfaction**, or perceived **ease of use.** 
>- These scores measure how well the project delivered what it set out to do and how well it satisfies customer and stakeholder needs. 
>- Customer satisfaction scores generally represent a *combined metric*—the sum of several different happiness metrics. 


#### Adoption and engagement

>[!important] Definition
>**Adoption** refers to whether or not a product, service or process is accepted and used. 

>[!example]
>Each project will need to define its own set of successful adoption metrics, such as:
> 
> - **Conversion rates**
>     
> - **Time to value (TTV)**
>     
> - **Onboarding completion rates**
>     
> - **Frequency of purchases**
>     
> - **Providing feedback (rating the product or service)**
>     
> - **Completing a profile**


>[!important] Definition
>**Engagement** refers to the degree to which it is used—the frequency of use, amount of time spent using it, and the range of use. 
>


>[!important] Definition
>Measuring stakeholder participation by 
>- tracking the **frequency of communication**, 
>- **responses** to emails or updates, 
>- **attendance** at meetings, 
>- or **level of input** can give you a sense of whether or not stakeholders are finding value in the project.

- [[Project Initiation Stakeholder Analysis]]

>[!quote]
>A *lack of meaningful engagement* could put your project at risk. 
>- Stakeholders may not be aware of changes or the overall progress of the project, and therefore the final outcome of the project may not meet their expectations. 
>- **Measuring team member engagement** is vital to the success of your project because the more engaged they are, the more productive they are, and the more likely they are to produce high-quality results.


## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Data, metrics and analytics are all important to the success of your project. You'll need to have some familiarity with how to collect and measure data, and how to use the data to tell you about different aspects of your project. Depending on the project and its unique goals, some metrics will be more important than others. It's your job to make sure you understand which metrics your stakeholders are most interested in and what elements impact your team's ability to deliver quality results on time and within budget.
