## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Execution Effective Escalation Email

## Escalation email best practices

>[!important]
>**Effective escalation emails** apply these *five best practices*:
> 
> - Maintain a **friendly tone**
>     
> - State your **connection** to the project
>     
> - Explain the **problem**
>     
> - Explain the **consequences**
>     
> - Make a **request**


### Maintain a friendly tone

>[!quote]
>When drafting an escalation email, you may feel tempted to get straight to the point, especially when dealing with a stressful and time-sensitive problem. 
>
>But keep in mind that it is important to *address issues* **with grace**. 
>- Consider opening your email with a simple *show of goodwill*, such as “I hope you’re doing well.” 
>- When describing the issue, aim for a **blameless tone.** 
>- Above all, keep the email **friendly** and **professional**. 
>	- After all, you are asking for the recipient’s help. 
>- Be sure to *close* your email by **thanking** the recipient for their time.


### State your connection to the project

>[!quote]
>*Introduce yourself early* in the email if you have *less familiarity* with the project stakeholders. 
>- Be sure to clearly state your name, *role*, and **relationship to the project**. 
>- This helps the reader understand why you are reaching out. 
>- Keep your introduction *brief* and *to the point*—a single sentence should suffice. 
>  
>If you know the person on the receiving end of the escalation email, you can simply *reinforce your responsibility* on the project before getting straight to the problem.


### Explain the problem

>[!quote]
>Once you greet your recipient and briefly introduce yourself, **explain the issue** at hand. 
>- Clearly *state the problem* you need to solve. 
>- Provide enough *context* for the reader to understand the issue, but aim to keep your message as **concise** as possible. 
>	- Avoid long, dense paragraphs that may obscure your message and tempt the reader to skim.

### Explain the consequences

>[!quote]
>After explaining the problem, clearly **outline the consequences**. 
>- Describe specifically how this issue is *negatively impacting* the *project* or how it has the potential to negatively impact the project later in the *project timeline*. 
>- Again, keep your explanation **concise** and your **tone friendly**.


### Propose a course of action and make a request

>[!quote]
>This is the **central piece** of a *strong escalation email*. 
>- In this section, you **propose a solution (or solutions)** and **state what you need** from the recipient. 
>- A **thoughtful solution** accompanied by a **clear request** lets the recipient know how they can help and moves you toward a resolution.



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>All projects—even those managed by experienced project managers—occasionally have problems. 
>
>Your role as the **project manager** is to *help resolve problems* and *remove barriers* that prevent your team from making progress toward your goals. 
>- While many problems might be small enough to resolve within your core team, other problems—like a major change in your budget or timeline—may need to be brought to stakeholders for a final decision. 
>- *Detailing these problems*, their *potential impact*, and the support you need in a clear and direct email to your audience can be an effective communication tool.
