### Success Criteria

>[!important] Definition
>The **success criteria** 
>- tell you whether or not the *project as a whole* was successful.
>- are the *specific details* of your *goals* and *deliverables* that tell you whether you've *accomplished* what you set out to do.
>- the *standards* by which the project will be *judged* once it's been delivered to stakeholders and customers.
>

>[!info]
>**Defining success criteria** also *clarifies* for your team what they're trying to accomplish beyond just launching something to users.
>- it's important that a team is *aligned* and working towards a shared goal.
>- Sometimes forcing the conversation and *clarifying what the __end result__* looks like can bring to light *questions* and *areas of disagreement.*

- [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Chapter Summary 2]]

### Determine the Success Criteria

>[!important] 
>To **determine the project success**, consider the following suggestions
>- identify the *measurable* aspect of your project.
>- get clarity from stakeholders on the project *requirements* and *expectations*:
>	- Who ultimately says whether or not the project is successful?
>	- What criteria will be measured to determine success?
>	- What's the success of this project based on?
>- collect *information* and *write* and *share documentation*
>- The *metrics* you choose should be as closely aligned to your *project's goal* as possible

#### Customer Metric

>[!example]
>- **Adoption metrics** might include launching a new product to a group of users and having a high amount of them use or adopt it.
>- **Engagement metrics** might include increasing the daily usage of a design feature or increasing orders and customer interactions.

#### Product Metric

>[!quote]
>The product, or final result, of a project has its own set of attributes that define success. 
>- The **product attributes** that are necessary for the product’s success include completeness in features, quality of features, unit cost, usability, etc. 
>- The *__extent__ that a product is complete* will contribute to the **product’s success**. This can apply to any project in which you deliver a product or tangible outcome at the end. 
>- To keep us on track for success, we can create a list of *product requirements* to ensure that you do not miss anything.

>[!important]
>To measure the success of a product, consider including these metrics on your checklist: 
> 
> - Track if you implemented the product’s **priority requirements**
>     
> - Track and *assess* the product’s number of **technical issues** or **defects**
>     
> - Measure the **percentage of features** you **delivered** or released at the end of the project

#### Priorities and Important Matters from Stakeholder

>[!quote]
>We have to pay attention to product metrics, but we also have to be mindful of stakeholder and customer **additional expectations** for *features and objectives*.
>
>Often, you can measure the *fulfillment of strategic goals* via user or customer metrics. Metrics to consider include:
>- Evaluating **user engagement** with the product 
>     
>- Measuring stakeholder and customer **satisfaction** via surveys
>     
>- Tracking user **adoption** of the product by using sales data

### Track and Communicate Success Criteria


>[!quote]
>It's not enough just to make a list of criteria; you need a **process** for **measuring success** from start to finish throughout the *entire project life cycle*.
>- This way, you can make adjustments and ensure success by the time you're ready to land.

>[!quote]
>- It's a good idea that, along with each **success criteria** on your list, to also include 
>	- the **methods** for how success will be **measured**,
>	- *how often* it's measured, and who's responsible for measuring it.
>- **Share** your success criteria document with your stakeholders and *ask* if they *agree* with how the project's success will be determined.
>- It's also a good idea to have the appropriate stakeholders **sign off** on the success criteria. 
>	- This way, everyone will be clear on who is responsible for which tasks,
>	- and you'll all thoroughly understand what the path to success entails.
>- Keep this *documentation* **visible** throughout the duration of the project and **clearly communicate** it with your team *every step of the way*.

>[!quote]
>defining your success criteria should create **greater alignment** within the team and give everybody better visibility into how to achieve success.
>- Clarity around success metrics also helps teams *prioritize* which efforts are *most impactful* to their users.
