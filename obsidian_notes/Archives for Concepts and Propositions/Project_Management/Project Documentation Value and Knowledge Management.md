## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Documentation Value and Knowledge Management

### Benefits of Project Documentation

>[!important] 
>**Documentation storage** and **sharing** is very important.

>[!important]
>**Documentation in one centralized place** 
>- makes communication quicker, easier, and more streamlined
>	- everyone knows *where to find* any information they need.
>- provides **visibility** and **accountability**.
>	- Having up-to-date plans will help ensure there's no room for **misinterpretation** or **miscommunication**.
>- provides **continuity**.

### Access

>[!important]
>Not everyone needs *full access* to project documentation.
>- **summarize** the relevant information into a *status report* for those who need to stay informed of final outcomes but don't need all background information.
>- make sure the people in *relevant roles* are granted access to those documents.
>	- make sure the project can carry on without your presence.

>[!important] Definition
>**Need-to-know basis** refers to telling someone facts they *need to know* *at the time* they *need to know* them, and nothing more. 

### Knowledge Management

>[!info]
>It's always useful to store guides, manuals, meeting notes, plans, and processes **all in a centralized place** and **clearly labeled**.


>[!important] Definition
>**Knowledge management** is a way of ensuring that project data can be accessed in the future by others who need it for informing decisions or planning for similar projects.

>[!quote]
>If someone needs to review this project for making decisions or planning *similar projects*, they should be able to *easily access* the information they need.
>
>It also helps *set the tone for future projects* and future project managers, which can be incredibly helpful if you happen to be the one jumping onto a new project.


## Explanation

>[!important]
>**Pro tip**: 
>- Determine **what** kind of information to share with **whom** and **when**.
>- Protect **sensitive data** from unauthorized viewers
>	- Only share information on a **need-to-know basis**

>[!quote]
>As a project manager, your goal is to have all of your *project resources* **documented** and **linked** in a way to where you or anyone *on the project can access* what they need quickly.
