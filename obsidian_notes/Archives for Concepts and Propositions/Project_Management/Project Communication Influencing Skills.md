### Conger’s four steps

>[!important] Definition
>Conger’s *four steps* of influencing:
>- **Establish credibility**
>	- When trying to persuade another person to listen to you, it helps to establish credibility. 
>	- Ask yourself, why should this person listen to you? 
>	- According to Conger, it is best to draw credibility from both **expertise** and **relationships**.
>		- You can build credibility by showing a *level of expertise* on the topic at hand. 
>			- it also helps to have “*a history of sound judgement*.”
>		- You can also build credibility through *strong relationships* with your audience and others around you.
>			- influential leaders tend to show their *trustworthiness* and *willingness to do right* by their colleagues over time
>- **Frame for common ground**
>	- Make a case for how your idea would *benefit* your audience
>		- you can determine how your ideas will benefit your audience by gaining a *strong understanding* of *them* and *what they value*.
>	- Pay close attention to *what matters* to your audience by *listening carefully* and *gathering information* during meetings and conversations. 
>		- Then frame your ideas based on your audience’s needs and interests.
>- **Provide evidence**
>	- provide *evidence* that supports your ideas.
>	- The best persuaders pair *numbers* with *vivid language*.
>	- They share *stories*, *examples*, and *metaphors* to help influence their audiences. 
>		- Using vivid language can help bring your figures to life and draw stakeholders’ interest to your proposal.
>- **Connect emotionally**
>	- illustrate that you are *emotionally invested* in the idea that you are presenting. 
>	- But crucially, Conger notes, you must also do your best to *determine* and *match* the *emotional state* of your *audience*.

### Using sources of power to influence

>[!quote]
>influencing is about more than just your approach. In fact, so much of your ability to influence others comes from your own **sources of power**.
>- Throughout your career, you'll rely on your sources of power to influence others to do great work in service of the project goals.
