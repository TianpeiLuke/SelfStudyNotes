## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Execution Aircover for Team

>[!important] Definition
>**Air cover** refers to support for and protection of a team in the face of *out-of-scope requests* or criticism from leadership.

- [[Project Execution Leadership Skills]]

### Saying “No” without explicitly saying “No”

>[!important]
>
>
>One way to provide air cover to your team is to **say “no”** to your sponsor’s request **without _explicitly_ saying “no.”**
>
>There are a few ways to do this:
> 
> - You can **gently push back** with a *polite explanation* that their request won’t be possible to complete under the *current constraints*—the scope, time, and/or cost—of the project. 
>     
> - You can **politely** offer to **get back** to the stakeholder *with your response*. 
> 	- This gives you time to better understand the request and to consult with trusted team members to *lay out the benefits and costs* of this request. 
> 	- And, if you are lucky, this might even give the stakeholder the opportunity to reconsider their request or forget about it entirely.

>[!info]
>Whether you choose to push back immediately or get back to your stakeholder with your response, it is crucial to **offer alternative solutions.**
>- Maybe the project timeline can expand to accommodate the request. 
>- Or maybe you and your team have a strong relationship with another team at the organization that can help fulfill  the request. 
>- Whatever the alternative, **brainstorming other options** can help soften the blow and provide stakeholders with new ideas.

### Intervening from behind the scenes

>[!important]
>Another way project managers provide air cover for their teams is to master the challenge of **delicately intervening from behind the scenes** when a stakeholder is making unrealistic requests or offering unreasonable critiques.

>[!info]
>**Managing the expectations** of your stakeholder while looping in relevant teammates on a need-to-know basis was essential here. 
>- This allowed your team to focus on their work without the possibility of an increased workload or an unnecessary distraction.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>A lot of what we have covered throughout this program has focused on leading and managing a project team. Much of project management involves overseeing the work of others, but it also involves managing the needs and expectations of those *above you*. Those people are your stakeholders, project sponsors, and other leaders within your organization. 
>
>Though the needs and requests of your stakeholders are crucial to the project’s success, there may come a time when you will need to *prioritize the needs of your team* over the wants of your stakeholders. This is called providing “**air cover**” for your team, and it is an important part of managing a project. The ability to effectively provide air cover requires a trusting relationship between a project manager and their stakeholders. In this relationship, the project manager aims to demonstrate their abilities to lead a team and communicate effectively. 
>
>There is some risk involved in providing air cover. Sometimes a project manager provides air cover and the project team is still unable to deliver on the goals of the project. In this case, stakeholders may question the project manager’s ability to complete projects successfully. So, when preparing to *defend your team against out-of-scope requests*, be sure that you are *confident* in your team’s progress toward the project goal.

>[!info]
>Providing air cover for your team takes practice. 
>
>It requires a **careful balance** of the needs of your stakeholders and the needs of your project team. 
>
>As you become more experienced in leading projects, you will develop a stronger sense of how to manage nuanced situations like these and provide the air cover your team needs to do their best work.
