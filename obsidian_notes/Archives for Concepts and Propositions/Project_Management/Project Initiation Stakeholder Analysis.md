## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Initiation Stakeholder Analysis

![[Project Initiation Identifying and Working with Stakeholders#^c5fa2f]]

![[Project Initiation Identifying and Working with Stakeholders#^028ef3]]

>[!important]
>The steps for **stakeholder analysis**
>- Make a list of all the *stakeholders* that the project impacts.
>- Determine the *level of interest* and *influence* for each stakeholder
>- Assess their ability to *participate*, and find ways to *involve them*

>[!important] Definition
>**Influcence** measures 
>- how much power a *stakeholder* has 
>- and how much this stakeholder' action *affect the project outcome*.

>[!important] Definition
>**Stakeholder buy-in** is the process of
>- *involving* the stakeholders in decision-making 
>- to hopefully reach a *broader consensus* on the organization's future.


### Power Grid

>[!important] Definition
>A **power grid** shows stakeholder interest _in_ the project versus their influence _over_ the project.
>- It is used for conducting a stakeholder analysis.
>- We use the power grid to assign each stakeholder's *level of importance* to the project, measuring their 
>	- **interest** 
>	- and **influence**.
>- The *position* of the stakeholder on the grid usually determines their *active role* in the project.
>	- The higher the interest and influence, the more important the stakeholder is to the project's success.
>- It helps to *track* who should be communicated with and when.

#### Quadrant I (Top Right): Key Stakeholder

>[!important]
>**Key Stakeholder** (*high interest* and *high power*):
>- They can greatly impact project decisions and success.
>- include project sponsors, key executives, or regulatory authorities.
>- Hint: **Manage Closely**
>- **Engagement and Involvement:**
>	- Keep these stakeholders *well-informed* and *engaged* *throughout* the project lifecycle.
>	- Involve them in decision-making processes, seeking their *input* and *feedback*.
>	- Address their concerns *promptly* and *effectively*.
>- **Regular Communication:**
>	- Schedule *regular meetings* or updates to keep them informed about project progress and any issues.
>	- *Tailor communication* to their *preferences* and needs to ensure they remain *supportive* and engaged.


#### Quadrant II (Top Left):  Low Interest but High Power

>[!important]
>**Stakeholder** with *low interest* and *high power*
>- include senior managers who need to be informed but may not be actively engaged.
>- Suggestion: **Meet Their Needs**
>- **Executive Summaries:**
>	- Provide *high-level summaries* of project progress and *key decisions* for their *review*.
>	- *Focus* on the *impact* of the project on organizational goals and objectives.
>- **Periodic Updates:**
>	- Provide *periodic briefings* or updates to ensure they are *informed* of *major milestones* and *critical project changes*.


#### Quadrant III (Bottom Right): High Interest but Low Power

>[!important]
>- **Stakeholder** with *high interest* and *low power*
>	- They are typically looking for updates and information about the project
>	- Suggestion: **Show consideration**
>	- **Regular Updates:**
>		- Communicate project progress, risks, and updates to *keep* them *engaged* and *informed*.
>		- Address their *queries* and concerns *promptly* to *maintain their interest*.
>	- **Stakeholder Feedback:**
>		- *Seek their feedback* on project plans, progress, and outcomes to ensure their *perspective* is *considered*.


#### Quadrant IV (Bottom Left): Low Interest and Low Power

>[!important]
>**Stakeholder** with *low interest* and *low power*
>- they might include lower-level employees or departments not directly impacted by the project.
>- It might just be that for this particular project, they *aren't as integral*
>- **General Communication:**
>	- Share *general updates* about the project's overall progress *without overwhelming* them with details.
>	- Address any specific questions they may have, but *avoid unnecessary inundation* with project-related information.
>- **Minimal Engagement:**
>	- Maintain a *basic level* of communication and engagement to keep them *aware* of the project *without distracting* them from their regular responsibilities.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
> Here are some important things to keep in mind when communicating with stakeholders:
> - If you have one main stakeholder, that stakeholder is likely to be **highly influential** and *needs constant communication*.
> - But if you're on a larger project with numerous stakeholders, they won't be quite as involved in the day-to-day tasks.
> - For stakeholders who need time to make decisions about the project, *over-communicate* early on.
> 	- For example, hold frequent meetings and send daily end-of-day progress emails.
> 	- This way, they have enough time to weigh the options and make decisions.
> - Think about the level of project details each stakeholder needs. 
> 	- You don't want to spend time diving deep with stakeholders that just need a project summary.

### Generating stakeholder buy-in

>[!quote]
>Once you organize and assess your stakeholders, it is time to start making some decisions on whose **buy-in** is absolutely necessary for success, whose **requirements** deserve the most attention, and what level of communication each stakeholder will require.
>
>Gaining **key stakeholder buy-in** is essential to ensuring that your project is not deprioritized or deprived of resources. 
>
>Tips for gaining key stakeholder buy-in include: 
> 
> - Clearly *mapping the work* of the project to the *goals* of the stakeholder.
>     
> - Describing how the project *aligns with the goals* of the stakeholder's department or team.
>     
> - Listening to *feedback* from the stakeholder and finding ways to *incorporate* their feedback into the *project's charter* where appropriate.
>     
> 
> Manage your stakeholders’ **expectations** by presenting a *realistic view* of your team’s abilities. 
> - Do *not over-promise* and *under-deliver*!
