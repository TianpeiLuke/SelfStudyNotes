>[!important] Definition
>The [Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/) developed the following framework as a helpful guide for ethical decision-making.
>- **Recognize an ethical issue**
>	- begin to question the ethics of an issue by asking yourself questions about the nature of the issue.
>- **Get the facts**
>	- Decide what you should do about the issue, and seek answers as needed. Consult with the right people to consider all of the options available to you.
>- **Evaluate alternative actions**
>- **Make a decision and test it**
>	- Once you have chosen an option, test it by imagining the reaction to your choice from a person whose opinion you value.
>- **Act and reflect on the outcome**
>	- Consider how to carry out your decision with thoughtfulness and care, and after you act, consider the results of your decision.



## Explanation

>[!example]
>You can evaluate alternative actions by asking yourself the following questions:
> 
> - “Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm?”
>     
> - “Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?” 
>     
> - “Which option treats people equally or proportionally?”
>     
> - “Which option best serves the community as a whole, not just some members?”
>     
> - “Which option leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be?”
