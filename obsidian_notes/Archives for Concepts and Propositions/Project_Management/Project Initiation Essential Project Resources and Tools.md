## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Initiation Essential Project Resources and Tools

![[Project Initiation Key Components#^c69f9c]]

- [[Project Initiation Key Components]]


>[!important] Definition
>**Project resources**  are who and what you depend on to complete a project, which include
>- the *budget*, 
>- *people*, 
>- *materials*, 
>- and other items that you will have at your disposal.

- [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Chapter Summary 2]]

### Budget 

>[!important] Definition
>**Budget** is an estimate of the *amount of money* a project will cost to complete

>[!quote]
>During the initiation phase, you'll talk to the stakeholders and the people working on the project to figure out the tasks needed to get the project done.
>
>Here, you might ask questions to help uncover hidden costs.
>- *taxes*
>- *fees*
>
>You'll often include the budget in the project charter, and the stakeholders review it for approval

>[!quote]
>As a project manager, you will take the same general approach with your project budget. 
> 
> Common aspects of your project budget will include:
> 
> - **Team**: the cost of the people performing the work
>     
> - **Services**: any outside vendors helping your project
>     
> - **Materials**: any tangible items purchased to complete the project
>     
> 
> Throughout your project management career, you will encounter various types of projects with a wide range of budgets. 
> - Some budgets will have *no margin for error*, whereas other budgets may be *more flexible*. 
> - Regardless of this variability, budget issues will inevitably arise, so it is important to make sure that the *budget* is aligned with the *project scope* and the *stakeholders’ asks*.

### People

>[!quote]
>**People** are a vital resource on your project; you cannot complete your project on your own! You will need to rely on a strong team of people with a variety of skill sets and specialties to get the job done. 
>
>As a project manager, make sure that 
>- you have *commitment* and *buy-in* on the number of hours it will take for your resources to complete their tasks. 
>- Additionally, you will find the best partners on a project are people who are *aligned to the goals* of the project or who are *most interested* in the project's work.

>
>It helps you to
>- *track* task deadlines
>- provide *visibility* to others
>- manage a *budget*
>- create helpful *diagrams*
>- manage *contracts*


>[!quote]
>Tools are essential for **tracking progress**, so you want to keep them top of mind at all phases of your project.
>- They're useful because they can help you *track detailed information* about all kinds of tasks,
>- and they make it easy to *communicate* with lots of different people.

>[!info]
>Common tools include  
>- **scheduling** and **work management software** 
>- and tools for **productivity**

## Explanation


>[!quote]
>**effective communication and tracking** are huge parts of a project manager's day-to-day responsibilities.

>[!quote]
>Here are some important considerations and keys to successfully introducing new tools:
> 
> - **Discuss the tool early and often, if possible.** 
> 	- The team should not feel blindsided by a new change. Make sure they know the change is coming as early as possible. This will help them prepare for an introduction or migration to the new tool.
>     
> - **Ask for feedback from key stakeholders.** 
> 	- You could get great feedback on features that you may have overlooked by asking for their expertise. You can solicit this feedback by requesting their input about functionality or have them list features in order of priority. The key is to create an opportunity for stakeholders to provide their feedback and allow you to incorporate their feedback into next steps.
>     
> - **Involve the key stakeholders in demonstrations as you get closer to making the final decision on the project tracking tool.** 
> 	- You will be able to leverage key stakeholders' acceptance by letting them test the product or sign up for a trial run. It is also important to make sure that the tool is actually going to meet the mark and provide a meaningful change for the project. 
> 	- You may want to pull in key users from your team to test and familiarize themselves with the tool prior to rolling it out. This will allow the team to get on board with your plans or discuss their concerns beforehand. This will also highlight in-house experts for future training, assistance, and implementation.
>     
> - **Ensure the tool is fully functional** **before** **the team is introduced to it.** 
> 	- Whenever possible, hold off from introducing the tool if it still has any issues. Make sure the tool is accessible for all users. Keep in mind, your team members may resist a tool that doesn’t live up to how it is supposed to function. This will impact implementation and acceptance fairly significantly, so put your best tool forward!
>     
> - **Set up training for the tool as needed** **before** **you ask the team to actually use it.** 
> 	- Everyone has different levels of comfort with different tools. It is your job as the project manager to ensure that each team members’ needs are addressed. Setting up training also helps create positive first impressions, which will lead to higher productivity and quicker, more successful implementation and acceptance.
>     
> 
> Remember, some pushback is normal, but successful project managers should take the steps to prepare and mitigate any friction for their team when possible. 
> 
> **Pro tip:** If time allows, plan for a period of transition if you are replacing an existing tool. It is common to allow both tools to operate during this period. You will need to “sunset,” or retire, the existing tool eventually, but allowing for a period of transition between using the old tool and the new tool can help stakeholders and team members feel more at ease and give them time to gain familiarity with the new tool. Be prepared for productivity to be impacted as the team transitions from one tool to another.
