## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Execution Effective Presentation


>[!important] Definition
>**Storytelling** is the process of turning facts into narrative to communicate something to your audience.

>[!important]
>we'll go over some best practices to tell a great story using data,
>- **Define** your **audience**
>- **Collect** the **data**
>- **Filter** and **analyze** the data
>- Choose a **visual representation**
>- Shape the **story**
>- Gather your **feedbacks**


### Preparation

>[!important] 
>The following tips are the the *best practice* to *prepare* for **effective presentation**
>- Get clear on your **goals** and the **purpose** of your presentation
>	- Be *clear* and *specific* about what you want to get out of the meeting
>	- Frame the discussion with that goal in mind.
>- Seek **input** and set **expectations**
>	- Ask your *manager* or check with *stakeholders* regarding the *goals*. 
>	- Get their input and feedback *ahead* of time.
>		- If you were invited to *present*, make sure you understand in advance exactly *what* the requestor is hoping to *gain* from your presentation.
>- Create a **delivery plan**
>	- Identify a *headline* for each slide, which is the *one-sentence main point* that you are trying to illustrate with that slide.
>	- Create a couple of **supporting points** that add interest to the headline, such as anecdotes, charts, data, etc.
>	- Build in **signposts**. These are ways to clue the audience in to where you are going and what to expect with your presentation.
>	- **Limit the number of slides** in the main presentation. 
>		- At the same time, consider creating **backup slides** for potential challenges, difficult questions, trade-offs, or alternative solutions. 
>		- You can hide these backup slides at the end of your presentation if you don’t need them, or add them into your presentation if you do.
>- Be mindful of your **audience’s time.**
>	- Invite only participants who need to be there.
>	- Send the presentation ahead of time, if possible.
>- Develop a **strategy** for making your presentation **memorable**.
>	- Use *stories* and *repeat key points*.
>	- Start with a strong intro. Spend extra prep time on the beginning. The beginning is when your nerves are typically the highest, and delivering the introduction successfully can help you quickly gain confidence.

### Practice

>[!important] 
>The following tips are the the *best practice* for **effective presentation**
>- **Guide** your audience through your presentation.
>	- Help them notice what you notice, 
>	- *transition* between slides by using phrases like “Building on this point . . .” or “As I mentioned before . . .”
>- Do a **mock presentation** with your team.
>	- If there will be more than one presenter, coordinate what each person will cover and how you will manage handoffs.
>	- Practice a **question-and-answer (Q&A) session**, anticipating the kinds of questions your participants might ask so you are prepared with a quick and confident response. 
>	- In addition, practice what you will say if you are asked a question that you *don’t know the answer* to.
>	- Be prepared to run the whole meeting *yourself*. 
>		- If a co-presenter fails to show up, are you prepared to step in?
>- **Schedule** time to practice.
>	- Once you’ve *outlined* what you want to say, *practice* it—ideally in front of a mirror—or record yourself. 
>	- This may help you identify awkward *phrasing* that could be improved and other issues.
>- Be *prepared* for *surprises.*
>	- Show that you can *adapt* and that you know your **subject matter**.
>		- If time runs short, can you quickly summarize the key points?
>		- Can you pivot the content according to what is most important to your audience?




### Presentation and pace

>[!important]
>The following tips are the the *best practice* for **presentation and pace**
>- Get **right to the point**.
>	- Identify what *problem* you are solving and state it *up front*.
>	- Lay down the *ground rules*. 
>	- For example, 
>		- how do you want to handle questions and comments? 
>		- Will you take them throughout your presentation or afterwards?
>- Check your **pace**.
>	- Be mindful of clues from your audience and adjust accordingly.


### Follow up

>- If appropriate, send a **follow up email** with 
>	- **summary notes**, 
>	- **action items**, 
>	- and **time frames**.
>     
> - **Debrief** with your manager or key audience members on what they heard from the presentation.  
> 	- Ask them what went well and what could have gone better.
>     
> - **Review next steps**.




## Explanation

- [[Project Communication]]

>[!quote]
>One way I ensure that my slideshow presentations are as precise as they can be is by using a technique called "**designing for five seconds**."
>-  The idea is that your audience should be able to *understand a slide* within *five seconds*.
>- So I keep my presentation slides *simple*, including only the most relevant data points, to *avoid overloading* my audience with *text* they don't have time to read.


>[!important] Tips
>- Consider the approach you'd take if you had to *shorten your presentation* **unexpectedly**.
>- Practice to *avoid mistakes* that could distract from your message.
>- Identify and come up with *answers* to **potential audience questions**.
>- Imagine and prepare for possible *objections*


>[!important]
>Be **memorable**. Develop a strategy that helps make your narrative unforgettable.
>- Use **stories** and **repetition**
>- Be aware of your **body language**
>	- Posture
>	- Tone of voice
>	- Pace
>		- Keep half speed of normal speed and keep sentence short
>	- Eye contact
>	- Warm and friendly facial expressions
>	- Confidence
