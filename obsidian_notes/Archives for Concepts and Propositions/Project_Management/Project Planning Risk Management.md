## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Planning Risk Management

### Risk and Issues

>[!important] Definition
>A **risk** is a *potential* event which *can occur* and can *impact* your project.

>[!important] Definition
>An **issue** is a known or *real* problem that can *affect* the ability to complete a task.

>[!info]
>- **risks** are the big *what-ifs* and
>- **issues** are things that *currently* impact a project.
>- a risk is an event that *could potentially happen*.
>- If the event *actually happens*, then the risk becomes an issue

### Risk Management


>[!important] Definition
>**Risk management** is the process of identifying and evaluating *potential risks* and *issues* that could impact a project.

>[!info]
>you'll need to do regularly to address potential risks.

- [[Project Planning]]

>[!info] 
>**Risk management** is a crucial part of the planning process
>- it provides an understanding of 
>	- *what* could go wrong with your project.
>	- *who* you need to consult about the risk.
>	- *how* the potential risk could be mitigated.

>[!info] 
> *Failing* to engage in meaningful risk management can have a few big consequences for your project.
> 
> -  If you don't plan ahead, you may put your project at risk of *not meeting its project goal*, its *timelines*, or *success criteria*.
> - By failing to plan for risks, you also fail to think through the *many different ways* that your project *could pivot* and still *meet its goals*.
> - Risks can affect projects in a variety of ways that are *difficult to foresee*.


### Phases of Risk Management

>[!important] Definition 
>**Risk management** is an ongoing practice throughout the life cycle of your project. It typically involves some variation of these five steps:
> 
>- **Identify the risk**.
>	- The first phase of the risk management process is to *identify and define potential project risks* with your team. 
>	- After all, you can only manage risks if you know what they are. 
>     
>- **Analyze the risk**.
>	- After identifying the risks, determine their *likelihood and potential impact* to your project. 
>	- Serious risks with a high probability of occurring pose the greatest threat.
>     
>- **Evaluate the risk**.
>	- Next, use the results of your risk analysis to determine which risks to *prioritize*.
>     
>- **Treat the risk**. 
>	- During this phase, *make a plan* for how to treat and manage each risk. 
>	- You might choose to ignore minor risks, but serious risks need detailed mitigation plans.
>     
>- **Monitor and control the risk**.
>	- Finally, assign team members to monitor, track, and mitigate risks if the need arises.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Good project planning means **searching for places where trouble might occur**. 
>- Where might the schedule get off track?
>- Where might the budget exceed your estimates?
>
>You'll work with your team to consider answers to these questions and prepare a risk management plan based on whatever you discover.

### Uncover opportunities using risk management

>[!quote]
>when identifying risks, it is important to also consider the good things that could happen, which are considered **opportunities**. 
>- An opportunity is a *potential positive outcome* of a risk. 
>- It is important to recognize opportunities and to capitalize on them as they appear so you can reach your project goals faster, more cheaply, or with less effort. 
>- Some examples of **opportunities** include: 
> 
> 	- Completing a milestone *ahead of schedule*
>     
> 	- *Discounted* materials 
>     
> 	- Availability of *additional resources* (people, investments, equipment)

>[!quote]
>As a project manager, you should always be on the lookout for potential opportunities when developing your risk management plan.
