## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Closure Project Impact Report

### Highlight key performance areas

>[!quote]
>The **purpose** of your **impact report** is to show your key stakeholders the impact your project had on the organization. 
>- Goals, 
>- objectives, 
>- budget, 
>- schedules, 
>- and **key performance indicators (KPIs)** need to be determined at the beginning of your project. 
>
>Your impact report should demonstrate how well you did against those early targets. 
>- In your report, you should also answer the question: 
>	- *What was the problem* we were trying to solve, 
>	- and *how did we solve* it? 
>- This will help you showcase the value your project outcome brought to the business.

>**Highlight** these **key performance areas** to demonstrate to your stakeholders how you achieved successful results and outcomes:
> 
> - First, describe the **goals** and **objectives** you set for the project and what you *hoped to have achieved* by the end. 
>     
> - Then, describe **how you met** those *objectives* against your **KPIs**. 
> 	- A **KPI** is a measurable value that demonstrates how *effective* a company is at achieving their objectives. 
> 	- In your impact report, **review** *how you defined the success* of your project at the beginning, and **highlight the outcomes** you achieved that demonstrate this success.
>     
> - Finally, showcase your **schedule** and **budget performance** by outlining your cost savings and efficiencies. 
> 	- Demonstrate that you met the deadlines set *in your project scope* and that your project was completed *within budget*.

>Metrics and data points are one of the best ways to present impact.

>Throughout your project, **collect data** and **track progress** in each of the areas you want to measure.

### Prepare an effective impact report presentation


>[!important] 
> An effective presentation can help your stakeholders understand your project’s impact. In order to successfully convey all of the information you have prepared: 
> 
> - **Be concise**. 
> 	- While you should share metrics that illustrate how you achieved your project goals, you do not need to include extraneous details. 
> 	- For clarity, organize information by using *bullet points* instead of paragraphs.
>     
> - **Understand your audience**. 
> 	- Make sure that your report does not use *too much technical language* or *jargon* to help your stakeholders understand it.
>     
> - **Use visuals.** 
> 	- Use a digital presentation application, such as Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Canva to present your impact report. 
> 	- Add *diagrams*, such as charts and graphs, to illustrate your results. 
> 	- Use *images* to add visual interest. 
> 	- Add *icons* to draw attention to information and help your stakeholders quickly understand information.
>     
> - **Describe your learnings.** 
> 	- Discuss lessons you learned during the course of the project and any areas you have identified for improvement.
>     
> - **Keep your stakeholders engaged**. 
> 	- Grab and keep your stakeholders’ attention by varying the way that you present your data:
>     
> 
> 	- **Show**: Play videos of demos, testimonials, or case studies.
>     
> 	- **Storytell**: Tell a story or anecdote related to the data in the report. 
>     
> 	- **Engage**: Ask for audience participation through questions, surveys, or quizzes.
