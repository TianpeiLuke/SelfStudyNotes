### Cash flow

>[!important] Definition
>**Cash flow** is the *inflow* and *outflow* of cash on your project. 
>- As a project manager, this is important to understand because you need **funding** (cash into your project) to keep your project running.
>- Monitoring cash flow allows you to have a *reference point* for your project’s health.

### CAPEX and OPEX

>[!important] Definition
>Organizations have a number of different types of expenses, from the wages they pay their employees to the cost of materials for their products. These expenses can be organized into different categories. 
>
>Two of the most common are **CAPEX (capital expenses)** and **OPEX (operating expenses)**.
> 
> - **CAPEX (capital expenses)** are an organization's *major*, *long-term*, *upfront expenses*, such as buildings, equipment, and vehicles. 
> 	- They are generally for *assets* that the company will own and keep. 
> 	- The company incurs these expenses because they believe they will create a benefit for the company *in the future*. 
>     
> - **OPEX (operating expenses)** are the *short-term expenses* that are required for the day-to-day tasks involved in running the company, 
> 	- such as wages, rent, and utilities. 
> 	- They are often *recurring*.

### Contingency reserves

>[!important] Definition
>Sometimes, a project hits a snag and incurs additional expenses. 
>
>One way to prepare for unplanned costs is by using **contingency reserves**. 
>- Contingency reserves are funds added to the estimated project cost to cover identified risks. 
>- These are also referred to as **buffers**.

>[!info]
>To determine the amount of your contingency reserves, you will need to go through the **risk management process** and identify the **risks** that are most likely to occur. 

>[!info]
>Contingency reserves can also be used to cover areas where *actual costs* turn out to be *higher than estimated costs*.
>- For example, you may estimate a certain amount for labor costs, but if a contracted worker on your team gets a raise, then the actual costs will be higher than you estimated.

### Management reserves

>[!important] Definition
>While contingency reserves are used to cover the costs of identified risks, **management reserves** are used to cover the *costs of unidentified risks*. 
>- For example, if you were managing a construction project and a meteor hit your machinery, you could use management reserves to cover the costs of the damage.
