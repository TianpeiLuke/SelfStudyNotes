## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Agile Project Management

>[!important] Definition
>**Agile** means
>- being able to move *quickly and easily*
>- *flexibility* and the willingness and ability to change and *adapt*.


![[Waterfall Project Management#^24c550]]


>[!important] Definition
>**Agile project management** is an *iterative approach* to managing projects that focuses on *continuous releases* and incorporates customer feedback with every iteration.
>- Project processes are *repeated* often *many times* during the life cycle
>- Team operates within *many shorter blocks of time*.
>- During each iteration, the team takes a *subset* of *all the project's activities** and does all the work required to complete that subset of activities. 
>- You can think of it as a lot of *mini waterfalls* for each activity.

>[!info]
>This iterative approach enables the project to move quickly, as well as making it much more adaptive to change.
>- So the term "**agile**" means 
>	- *flexibility*, 
>	- *repetition*, 
>	- and *openness to change*

>[!important] Definition
>**Agile project management** is an approach to project and team management based on the **Agile Manifesto**.
>- The manifesto is a collection of 
>	- four values and 
>	- 12 principles that define the *mindset* that all Agile teams should strive for.

### Manage Requirement

>[!quote]
>In Agile, requirements are treated as more *dynamic* and *expected to change* as the team receives feedback and new information.
>-  There's usually an *initial set of requirements* or feature ideas when the project kicks off, but that list of requirements and features is *continuously growing* and changing throughout the project.
>- The team works with stakeholders to *prioritize* the requirements, always moving the *most urgent or valuable items* to the *top* of the list.
>- Then, the team goes *down the list*, working on the requirements in iterations.
>	- By going down the list, the team is able to get feedback on their work quickly and frequently.
>- At the end of each iteration, the team *gets feedback* and can make *necessary adjustments* to the requirements before continuing on.

### Manage Documentation

>[!quote]
>in Agile, there's an *emphasis* on **real-time**, **person-to-person conversations**.
>- This doesn't mean that there's zero documentation; it's just in a different form.
>- Instead of *big, formal documents* with a *rigorous* change management and approval process, there are *shorter documents* that have just enough detail to achieve their purpose.
>- These documents are much *more focused* on what the reader *needs to know* to get the job done and are written only as needed.

### Manage Delieverables

>[!quote]
>Agile is just as exciting, but has **smaller more frequent releases**.
>- So each release has a less formal celebration, but it builds up to be just as exciting.
>- When there's lots of *uncertainty* in a project, such as in a new emerging industry or market, the *steady release* of project deliverables enables an Agile team to *get feedback and learn as they go*.

## Explanation


>[!important] 
>Agile aims to solve that problem by **getting customer feedback more quickly** to make sure that the team is building what the customer really wants

>[!quote]
>Part of working with an **Agile mindset** is always seeking out ways to work more efficiently.
>- We do this by finding ways to **streamline processes** *without* reducing *product quality or value*.
>- The key to streamlining is to reduce waste.
