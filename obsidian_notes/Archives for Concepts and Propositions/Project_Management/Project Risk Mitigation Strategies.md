## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Risk Mitigation Strategies

>[!important] Definition
>Let’s look at how these **four risk mitigation strategies** can be used for managing risks
>- **Avoid**  
>	- This strategy seeks to sidestep—or avoid—the situation as a whole.
>	- Taking action to eliminate the possibilities of a risk
>- **Minimize**
>	- Mitigating a risk involves trying to *minimize the catastrophic effects* that it could have on the project. 
>	- The *key* to minimizing risk starts with *realizing that the risk exists*. 
>	- That is why you will usually hear mitigation strategies referred to as **workarounds**.
>- **Transfer**
>	- The strategy of transferring *shifts the responsibility* of handling the risk to someone else.
>- **Accept**
>	- Lastly, you can accept the risk as the normal cost of doing business. 
>	- **Active** **acceptance of risk** usually means setting aside extra funds to pay your way out of trouble.
>		- **Passive** **acceptance of risk** is the “do nothing” approach. While passive acceptance may be reasonable for smaller risks, it is not recommended for most single point of failure risks. 
>		- It is also important to be **proactive and mitigate risks** ahead of time whenever possible, as this may save you from having to accept risks.
