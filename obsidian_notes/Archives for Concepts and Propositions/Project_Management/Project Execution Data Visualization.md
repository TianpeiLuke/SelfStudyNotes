## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Execution Data Visualization

- [[Project Execution Data-Informed Decision-Making]]
- [[Project Execution Common Data Metrics]]

### Show relationships

>[!important] Definition
>A **scatter plot**, sometimes referred to as a scatter chart or scatter graph, uses dots to represent values for two different variables. 
>- The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. 
>- **Scatter plots** will sometimes have a line drawn across its center. 
>	- This line is known as the **trend line** and highlights the direction the points are trending towards.
>- Scatter plots show the *relationship between data sets*, and can help us understand the impact of one factor on another.

>[!important]  
>  **Scatter plot best practices:** 
> 
> - Start the y-axis at 0 to represent data accurately.


### Comparing values

>[!important] Definition
>**Bar graphs** use size contrast to compare two or more values. 
>- Bar graphs are also a great way to *clarify trends* and *identify patterns*.

>[!example]
>In the example below, the time of day is compared to someone’s level of motivation throughout the whole work day. 
>
>![[example_bar_graph.png]]
>
>By comparing this data, we can tell that this person’s motivation is low at the beginning of the work day, and gets higher and higher by the end.

- [[Plot Multiple Bars Grouped]]

>[!important]
>**Bar graph best practices:**
> 
> - Use *consistent colors* throughout the chart
>     
> - Use *accent colors* to *highlight* important data points or changes over time
>     
> - Use *horizontal labels* so it is easier to read

### Demonstrating composition

>[!important] Definition
>**Pie charts** show us the *composition* of something. 
>- In other words, how much each part of something makes up the whole. 

>[!example]
>The **pie chart** below shows us all the activities that make up someone’s day. 
>- Half of it is spent working, which is shown by the amount of space that the blue section takes up. 
>- From a quick glance at this pie chart, you can easily tell which activities make up a good chunk of the day and which ones take up less time.
>

>[!important]
>**Pie chart best practices:** 
> 
> - Avoid including *too many categories* so it is easy to compare slices
>     
> - Make sure that the slice values *add up* to 100%
>     
> - *Order* slices according to *their size*

### Analyzing trends and behaviors

>[!important] Definition 
>Tracking trends can help us understand shifts or changes in our data. 
> 
> **Line graphs** are a great tool for visually *showing change* over time, but they can be paired with other factors, too. 


>[!example] 
> In the line graph below, we are using two lines to compare the popularity of cats and dogs over a period of time. 
> - Because the graph is using two different line colors, we can instantly tell that dogs are more popular than cats. 
> - We will talk more about using colors and patterns to make visualizations more accessible to audiences later, too. 
> - Even as the lines move up and down, there is a general trend upwards, and the line for dogs always stays higher than the line for cats.
>   
>   
>![[example_line_graph.png]]   

>[!important]
>**Line graph best practices**:
> 
> - To avoid clutter, don't show *more than four categories*.
>     
> - Organize *highly variable data at the top* of the chart to make it easy to read

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Before translating your data into a chart or graph, you should be clear on what you want to show your audience. 
>
>Figure out what data you want to use and _why._ 
>- You might want to **inform** your audience about a new trend or a valuable piece of information, or **show relationships** between data sets. 
>- Or maybe you need to **compare values,** understand the **composition** of something, 
>- or **analyze trends and behaviors over set periods of time.**
