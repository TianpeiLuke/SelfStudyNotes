## Explanation

### Project Managers

>[!quote]
>...  the **project manager** is responsible for the *overall success* of the team, and ultimately, the project as a whole. 
>- A project manager understands that paying close attention to *team dynamics* is essential to successfully completing a project, 
>- and they use *team-building techniques*, *motivation*, *influencing*, *decision-making*, and *coaching skills*, to keep their teams strong. 
>
>Project managers integrate all project work by 
>- developing the *project management plan*, 
>- *directing* the work, 
>- *documenting* reports, 
>- *controlling* change, 
>- and *monitoring* quality. 
>- In addition, project managers are responsible for *balancing* the scope, schedule, and cost of a project by managing engagement with stakeholders. 
>
>When managing engagement with stakeholders, project managers rely on 
>- *strong communication skills*, 
>- political and cultural awareness, 
>- *negotiation*, 
>- *trust-building*, 
>- and *conflict management skills*.

### Stakeholders

>[!quote]
>There will often be several parties that will hold stake in the outcome of a project. Each group’s level of investment will differ based on how the outcome of the project may impact them**.** Stakeholders are often divided into two groups: 
>- **primary stakeholders,** also known as key stakeholders, and **secondary stakeholders.** 
>- A primary stakeholder is directly affected by the outcome of the project, while a secondary stakeholder is indirectly affected by the outcome of the project.

### Sponsor


>[!quote]
>The **project sponsor** is another primary stakeholder. 
>
>A sponsor 
>- *initiates* the project 
>- and is *responsible* for *presenting* a business case for its existence, 
>- *signing* the project charter, 
>- and *releasing resources* to the project manager. 
>
>The sponsor is very important to the project, so it’s critical to **communicate** with them frequently *throughout all project phases*.
