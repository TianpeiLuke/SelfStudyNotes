## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Similarly, many job descriptions list the specific skills they require candidates to have. These skills can become some of the terms that you use in your job search. Examples of these skills include: 
> 
> - **Coordination**, or getting people and teams to work together. You may see responsibilities in job descriptions such as “coordination of efforts to achieve project deliverable” or “coordinate internal resources to ensure successful project completion.” 
> 	- Being a project manager is essentially *managing the coordination of resources* to achieve your end goal. 
> 	- **Coordination** is one of the **top skills** a project manager should have, so searching for this term can lead you to appropriate positions. 
>     
> - **Organization**, or the ability to stay focused on different tasks. 
> 	- You may come across phrases like “solid organizational skills, including attention to detail and multitasking skills” or something as simple as “highly organized.” 
> 	- **Organization** is *key* to being a great project manager. 
>     
> - **Leadership**, or being able to lead a group of people. 
> 	- You may see phrases like “strong leadership qualities” or “ability to lead” in job descriptions. 
> 	- A project manager needs to *display leadership* in a number of ways, including 
> 		- *effective planning*, 
> 		- *efficient task coordination*, 
> 		- *inspiring team members*, 
> 		- and *key decision-making*.
