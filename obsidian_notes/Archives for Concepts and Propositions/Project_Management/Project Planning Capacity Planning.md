## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Planning Capacity Planning

![[Project Planning Realistic Time Estimate#^7494f2]]

![[Project Planning Realistic Time Estimate#^4cbb80]]

>[!important] Definition
>**Capacity** refers to the *amount of work* that the people or resources assigned to the project can *reasonably complete* in a set period of *time*.

### Capacity Planning

>[!important] Definition
>**Capacity planning** refers to the act of 
>- *allocating people and resources* to *project tasks*, 
>- and determining whether or not you have the *necessary resources required* to complete the work *on time*.

### Capacity Planning Best Practice

>[!important]
>There are a few factors that can impact capacity and **capacity planning**.
>- **Identify parallel tasks vs. sequential tasks**:
>	- Parallel tasks are tasks that *can happen* in parallel
>	- Sequential tasks are tasks *must happen* sequentially, i.e. in a specific order.
>	- Efficiency can be improved when *multiple parallel are completed at the same time* (**parallelism**)
>	- Identifying *sequential tasks* helps you identify the tasks that you *need to* **prioritize early** on in the project.
>- Determine which project *tasks* have a **fixed start date**.
>	- A **fixed start date** refers to the date on which you *must start work* on your task in order to achieve your goal.
>	- help with **capacity planning** because it helps ensure that you'll have the *right number of people* available to complete tasks on time.
>- Determine which project *tasks* have an **early start date**.
>	- An **earliest start date** refers to the *earliest date* in which you *can begin* working on a task.
>	- It can set *accurate expectations* for when vendors and team members will be up and running on the project.
>	- This can help you plan your work and prioritize your work accordingly.
>- Identifying if a task has **float**, also sometimes known as **slack**.
>	- **Float** refers to the *amount of time* you can *wait* to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome.
>	- These are **high priority tasks** that have *low to no wiggle room*.
>	- Tasks on the **critical path** should have **zero float**, meaning there is no room for *delays*
>	- Tasks that do *have float* are *not* a part of the critical path
