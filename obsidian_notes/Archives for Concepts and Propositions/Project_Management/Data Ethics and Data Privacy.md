## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Data Ethics and Data Privacy

>[!important] Definition
>**Data ethics** is the study and evaluation of *moral challenges* related to data collection and analysis. 
>
>This includes 
>- *generating*, 
>- *recording*, 
>- *curating*, 
>- *processing*, 
>- *sharing*, 
>- and *using* data in order to come up with ethical solutions.


>[!info]
>Businesses apply data ethics practices so they can:
> 
> - **Comply with regulations**
>     
> - Show that they are *trustworthy*
>     
> - Ensure *fair* and reasonable data usage
>     
> - Minimize **biases**
>     
> - Develop a *positive public perception*

### Data privacy

>[!important] Definition
>**Data privacy** deals with the *proper handling* of data. 
>- This includes 
>	- the purpose of *data collection* and *processing*, 
>	- *privacy preferences*, 
>	- the way organizations *manage personal data*, 
>	- and the *rights* of individuals. 
>- It focuses on making sure the ways we collect, process, share, archive, and delete data are all *in accordance with* the *law*.
>- **Data privacy** is a key part of data ethics. 

### Data bias

>[!important] Definition
>**Data bias** is a type of error that tends to skew results in a *certain direction*. 
>- Bias can also happen if a sample group lacks inclusivity. 


>[!info]
>As a project manager, you have to think about *bias and fairness* from the moment you *start* collecting data to the time you *present* your conclusions.



>[!important] Definition
>There are different **types of biases** to keep in mind when setting up your data collection processes. 
>
>Here are four of the most common types of biases that could impact your data:
> 
> - **Sampling bias** is when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole. 
>     
> - **Observer bias** is the tendency for different people to *observe things differently*. 
>     
> - **Interpretation bias** is the tendency to always interpret situations that *don’t have obvious answers* in a *strictly positive* or *negative way*, when, in fact there is more than one way to understand the data. 
> 	- Data that does not provide an obvious set of conclusions makes some people feel anxious, which can lead to interpretation bias. 
>     
> - **Confirmation bias** is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>**Ethics** is about making the best possible decisions concerning people, resources, and the environment. 
>- Ethical choices diminish risk, advance positive results, increase trust, determine long term success, and build reputations. 
>- **Leadership** is absolutely dependent on *ethical choices*.
>
>-- Project Management Institute’s [Code of Ethics & Professional Conduct](https://www.pmi.org/about/ethics/code#:~:text=Ethics%20is%20about%20making%20the,absolutely%20dependent%20on%20ethical%20choices.)


>[!quote]
>As a project manager, it is your responsibility to protect the data you collect. You can help ensure the privacy of data collected from users, stakeholders, and others for your projects by:
> 
> - **Increasing data privacy awareness**. 
> 	- Make sure every member of your project team—plus the vendors, contractors, and other stakeholders from outside of your company—are made aware of your organization's data security and privacy protocols.
>     
> - **Using security tools**. 
> 	- Free security tools, like encrypted storage solutions and password managers, can decrease your project’s vulnerability to a data breach. 
> 	- In a lot of applications, like ones that are part of Google Workspace and Microsoft OneDrive, privacy settings can be adjusted to only give access to specific individuals.
>     
> - **Anonymizing data**. 
> 	- **Data anonymization** refers to one or more techniques such as blanking, hashing, or masking personal and identifying information to protect the identities of people included in the data. 
> 	- This helps protect individuals’ personal information by keeping them anonymous. 
> 	- Once the information has been anonymized, it can then be used and shared freely. 
> 	- *Types of data* that should be anonymized include names, telephone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, photographs, and account numbers.

>[!quote]
>A key way you can show your leadership skills is by exercising sound judgment when it comes to **data ethics**. 
>- In order to tell a project’s data-informed story to stakeholders, project team members, and others in an ethical way, you have to make sure you think about both privacy and bias-related concerns in how you conduct, analyze, and share that data.
