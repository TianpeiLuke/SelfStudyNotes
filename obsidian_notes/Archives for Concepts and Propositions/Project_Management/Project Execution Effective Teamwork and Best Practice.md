## Explanation

>[!example]
>For example, you might communicate with the team via *daily or weekly status update emails* and *regular team meetings*.
>
>*Team meetings* also provide a space for listening, whether you're gathering feedback on a workflow or process, or fielding questions from the group.
>
>You can also *solicit feedback or questions* via status update emails, since some people might feel more comfortable speaking in private.


>[!info]
>In addition to communicating and listening to the wider team, it's also your responsibility to **regularly connect** with *individual teammates*. 
>- You do this by gaining an understanding of communication styles and by asking people on your team how they prefer to communicate.
>- What's important to know is that everyone communicates differently.

>[!example]
>For example, during weekly status meetings, you might schedule time for open, thoughtful and inclusive discussions. 
>- You might model this by asking for help solving a problem that's impacting the team. 
>- You should encourage contributions from all team members regardless of role or rank. 
>- By doing this, you make clear to your teammates that they should feel comfortable challenging processes and workflows. 
>- And you make clear that critiques of the project and plans are welcomed and valued no matter who they come from. 
>- While it can feel challenging to provide and accept feedback, it's a healthy part of project management and usually makes for a better project outcome.

>[!quote]

>- By prioritizing and making that prioritization *known*, you keep the team *focused*.
>- Work with your team to *build consensus around priorities*, explaining your rationale can help you get their buy-in and increase their commitment to the work.
