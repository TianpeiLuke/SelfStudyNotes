## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: SMART or Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-bound Goals

![[Project Initiation Identifying Goals#^a23230]]

- [[Project Initiation Identifying Goals]]

>[!important] Definition
>**SMART** is the acronym for *five* critical criteria of *defining goals*, which include:
>- **Specific**: 
>	- The objective has *no ambiguity* for the project team to misinterpret.
>	- be specific about the *target*
>	- be specific about the *reason* and  *benefit*
>	- be specific about the *people involved*
>	- be specific about the *place to deliver* the project
>	- be specific about the *requirement* and *constraints*
>- **Measurable**: 
>	- *Metrics* help the project team determine when the objective is met.
>	- good to *track the progress* and *stay motivated*
>	- ask 
>		- how much 
>		- how many
>		- how will i know if this is accomplished.
>- **Attainable**
>	- The project team agrees the objective is *realistic*.
>	- can it be *reasonably reached* based on *metrics*?
>	- goal should be *a bit challenging* but not *too extreme*
>- **Relevant**
>	- The goal fits the organization’s *strategic plan* and supports the *project charter*.
>	- Does the goal *make sense*?
>	- Is the goal *worthwhile*?
>	- Consider *priorities*
>	- *Benefits* vs. *Costs*
>	- *Timing*
>	- *Budget*
>	- *Customer*
>- **Time-bound**
>	- The project team documents a date to *achieve the goal*.
>	- Put a **deadline** or a *clear time frame* to your goal
>

### Be Specific

>[!quote]
>- if your goal is *not specific*, you'll have trouble figuring out *how long* it should take to complete and *whether or not* you've accomplished it.

>[!quote]
>Specific goals should answer at least two of the questions I'm about to ask.
> 
> - **What** do I want to accomplish?
> 
> - **Why** is this a goal?
> 
> - Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or **benefit**?
> 
> - **Who** is involved? Who is the recipient? Employees, customers, the community at large?
> 
> - **Where** should the goal be delivered?
> 
> - Finally, **to what degree**?

### Be Measurable

>[!quote] 
> Measuring is not only a way for people to **track progress**, but also a tool to help people **stay motivated**.
> 
> - You can tell the goal is measurable by asking how much, how many, and how will I know when it's accomplished?
> 
> - Sometimes the *success of a goal* can be measured with a simple yes or no.

### Be Attainable

>[!quote]
>- Typically, you want goals that are a little challenging to *encourage growth*, otherwise, what's the point of the goal if nothing's going to change? 
>- However, you don't want it to be *too extreme* or you'll never reach it. 
>	- You'll have failed before you even started.
>- Aim to find a **balance** between the two extremes.

### Be Relevant

>[!quote]
>does it make sense to try and reach this goal?
>- Think about how the goal lines up with *other goals*, *priorities* and *values*.
>- Ask whether the goal seems worthwhile.
>- Does the *effort* involved balance out the *benefits*?
>- Does it match your organizations' *other needs* and *priorities*?
>	- Everyone, from the client, the project team, and the people who will ultimately use the product, need to feel like the goal is worth supporting.
>- Also, consider the *timing*. 
>	- Both the *amount of time* the project will take, 
>	- as well as the larger *economic and social contexts* can have big impacts.
>- There might be a *budget* to complete the project now, but will the company be able to sustain the project over time?
>- Is there an audience that will continue to use the product or service once it's delivered?
>
>Once you've got the answers to these questions, you should have a *clear goal* to help steer the project.
>- If you still don't feel confident about the project's goals, keep digging.
>- It's okay to ask questions if you have doubts.
>- Communicate your concerns with the project senior stakeholders and your direct supervisor if you have one. 
>- They should be able to address some of your concerns so that you can *feel confident* about moving forward.

### Be Time-Bound

>[!quote]
>**Deadlines** give you a way to *track your progress*, otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started.
>- *Time* and *metrics* often go hand in hand, because time can also be used as a metric.
>- Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to *break down* how much *needs to be accomplished* over time.



## Explanation

>[!warning]
>**Explain what makes the goal SMART** by answering the following questions:
> 
> 1. What makes the goal **specific**? Does it provide enough detail to avoid ambiguity?
>     
> 2. What makes the goal **measurable**? Does it include metrics to gauge success?
>     
> 3. What makes the goal **attainable**? Is it realistic given available time and resources?
>     
> 4. What makes the goal **relevant**? Does it support project or business objectives?
>     
> 5. What makes the goal **time-bound**?Does it include a timeline or deadline?

### Focusing on the "M" in SMART

>[!quote] 
> Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the **M** in SMART, which stands for **measurable**. Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on *quantifiable or tangible metrics*, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. 
> - Measurable goals are important because they leave *little room for confusion* around expectations from stakeholders. 
> 
> Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine *which metrics make sense* for the project. 
> - For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. 
> - Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.
