>	- be specific about the *requirement* and *constraints*
>- **Measurable**
>	- so that we can determine if the goals were *objectively met* 
>	- good to *track the progress* and *stay motivated*
>	- ask 
>		- how much 
>		- how many
>		- how will i know if this is accomplished.
>- **Attainable**
>	- can it be *reasonably reached* based on *metrics*?
>	- goal should be *a bit challenging* but not *too extreme*
>- **Relevant**
>	- Does the goal *make sense*?
>	- Is the goal *worthwhile*?
>	- Consider *priorities*

### Be Specific

>[!quote]
>- if your goal is *not specific*, you'll have trouble figuring out *how long* it should take to complete and *whether or not* you've accomplished it.

>[!quote]
>Specific goals should answer at least two of the questions I'm about to ask.
> 
> - **What** do I want to accomplish?
> 
> - **Why** is this a goal?
> 
> - Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or **benefit**?
> 
> - **Who** is involved? Who is the recipient? Employees, customers, the community at large?
> 
> - **Where** should the goal be delivered?
> 
> - Finally, **to what degree**?

### Be Measurable

>[!quote] 
> Measuring is not only a way for people to **track progress**, but also a tool to help people **stay motivated**.
> 
> - You can tell the goal is measurable by asking how much, how many, and how will I know when it's accomplished?
> 
> - Sometimes the *success of a goal* can be measured with a simple yes or no.

### Be Attainable

>[!quote]
>- Typically, you want goals that are a little challenging to *encourage growth*, otherwise, what's the point of the goal if nothing's going to change? 
>- However, you don't want it to be *too extreme* or you'll never reach it. 
>	- You'll have failed before you even started.
>- Aim to find a **balance** between the two extremes.

### Be Relevant

>[!quote]
>does it make sense to try and reach this goal?
>- Think about how the goal lines up with *other goals*, *priorities* and *values*.
>- Ask whether the goal seems worthwhile.
>- Does the *effort* involved balance out the *benefits*?
>- Does it match your organizations' *other needs* and *priorities*?
>	- Everyone, from the client, the project team, and the people who will ultimately use the product, need to feel like the goal is worth supporting.
>- Also, consider the *timing*. 
>	- Both the *amount of time* the project will take, 
>	- as well as the larger *economic and social contexts* can have big impacts.
>- There might be a *budget* to complete the project now, but will the company be able to sustain the project over time?
>- Is there an audience that will continue to use the product or service once it's delivered?
>
>Once you've got the answers to these questions, you should have a *clear goal* to help steer the project.
>- If you still don't feel confident about the project's goals, keep digging.
>- It's okay to ask questions if you have doubts.
>- Communicate your concerns with the project senior stakeholders and your direct supervisor if you have one. 
>- They should be able to address some of your concerns so that you can *feel confident* about moving forward.

### Be Time-Bound

>[!quote]
>**Deadlines** give you a way to *track your progress*, otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started.
>- *Time* and *metrics* often go hand in hand, because time can also be used as a metric.
>- Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to *break down* how much *needs to be accomplished* over time.
