>When you start a project, take time to **review your goals** and make sure they're well-defined.
> 
> To do this, you might need to get more information from your **stakeholders**. 
> - Talk to them about their **vision** for the project. 
> - Ask how this *aligns* to the company's *larger goals* and *mission*. 
> - By the end of that conversation, you and your stakeholders should *agree* to *support* the project goals in order to avoid running into issues later on.

>make sure that **before** you *start* your project, you, your stakeholders, and your team are all **clear** on the **project goals** so that you know you're making the right kind of progress.


### SMART Goals

>[!quote]
>To clarify these goals and keep the project on track, youâ€™ll turn them into **SMART goals**.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>**Goals** are important because they give you a **roadmap** to your destination. Without a clear goal in mind, how can you know where to go or how to get there?
>
>Now, one of the biggest differences between what makes a *good* goal and a *not-so-good* goal is how well it's defined. Meaning: how **clear** and **specific** is the goal. If the goal is your destination, are you *confident* you'll know when you've arrived?
