>[!info]
>**Completing a project** is *not the same thing* as **closing a project**.


>[!important] 
> In order to close a project, you must ensure that:
> 
> - All work is *done*.
>     
> - All agreed-upon *project management processes* have been *executed*.
>     
> - You have received **formal recognition and agreement** from key stakeholders that the project is done.


>[!important]
>there are a couple of different types of projects that you'll want to know about and *avoid*.
>- the **Never-Ending Project**
>	- The **never-ending project** exists when, for whatever reason, the project deliverables and tasks *cannot be completed.*
>	- Pay special attention to protecting the *scope of your project*, and you're much more likely to close a project successfully
>- the **Abandoned Project**
>	- The **abandoned project** exists when *inadequate handoff or transition* of the project deliverables occurs.
>	- The final deliverable never makes it to your customer.

### Avoiding the impact of project closure oversights

>[!important]
>*Oversights or skipping* steps in the **closing phase** of a project can:
> 
> - Impact the product’s or service’s *scheduled launch dates*.
>     
> - Put your organization at *legal risk*.
>     
> - Result in significant *financial losses* to your organization.
>     
> - Undermine your team's *credibility*, and yours.
>     
> - Damage your *relationship* with the customer or client.
>     


>[!quote]
> **All** of the steps of the project life cycle—initiating the project, making a plan, executing and completing tasks, and closing the project—are **essential** for a successful outcome. 
> 
> Unfortunately, closing the project is a phase that too often gets skipped, which can negatively impact both the project manager and their organization. 
> - To avoid these issues, make sure to plan for this phase just as you would any of the other project life cycle phases.
