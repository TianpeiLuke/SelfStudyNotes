## Explanation

### Too big, too small, or just right?

>[!quote]
>Once you lay the foundation for your project by outlining your goals and expectations, it is time to build your dream team! Though before we can build our dream team, we need to figure out **how many people we need**. 
>- This number will largely depend on the *size of the project* itself. 
>	- Complex projects with large divisions of work will usually require larger project teams. 
>	- Simple projects with straightforward expectations may only require a few people on the project team. 
>
>As a project manager, it is your job to help find the right balance based on what is needed.

### Who is available?

>[!quote]
>In projects, the **availability** of your team is always a *big concern*. 
>- This is especially true in **Matrix organizations**, where team members have multiple bosses. 
>- It is not uncommon to pull a team member onto another project before your project is complete. 
>- In a perfect world, you only pick those who can *stay* on the project for its *entire life cycle*. 
>- You may find that you don’t get to pick certain members of your team at all, which is called a **pre-assignment**. 
>	- In these cases, the sponsor assigns team members to your project.

>it is important to dedicate time early on in the team building process to **develop trust** between team members. 
>- Team members who understand one another are more likely to trust each other and feel safe sharing different points of view or offer a competing perspective. 
>- This will also allow them to more easily offer *constructive feedback* or be *supportive* if the team dynamics face challenges at any point.

### Who motivates them?

>[!quote]
>Be sure to take note of the **motivation level** of your team members and the impact it may have on your project. 
>- Just because a person is *pre-assigned* to a project, doesn’t necessarily mean they have low interest in it, but a person who *proactively volunteered* for it may have additional motivation to do the work.
>  
>As a project manager, it is your *responsibility* to **engage your team** and **keep them motivated**. 
>- This is where your *influence as a leader* is required to keep the team engaged and ready to overcome any obstacles that may appear. 
>- Engaging in a *respectful manner* and maintaining a *positive outlook* with your team during times of adversity are simple ways to keep your team motivated.
