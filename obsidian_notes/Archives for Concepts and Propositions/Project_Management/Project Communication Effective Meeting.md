## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Communication Effective Meeting


>[!quote]
>Plenty of things can make meetings unproductive, but an internal study at Google revealed that **productive meetings** have three elements in common:
> 
> 1. **Active participation** from attendees
>     
> 2. A **clear and concise** *agenda* that is followed throughout
>     
> 3. The **correct attendees** (meaning the participants can contribute to achieving the meeting’s goal)

### Before the meeting

>[!important]
>- **Prepare an agenda** that states the *purpose* and *goals* of the meeting, and **share** the agenda with participants.
>     
> - Only invite people who *need to be there* and who can help reach the goals of the meeting. 
> 	- Make participants’ *roles* and *responsibilities* for the meeting clear. 
> 	- Add *non-essential participants* as *optional* to the meeting invitation.
>     
> - If you are working with people in *different time zones*, share the time zone burden by **alternating recurring meeting times**.
>     
> - Evaluate the **need** *for the meeting* and **cancel** if *it isn’t necessary*. 
> 	- Consider whether the meeting content can be covered via email. 
>     
> - Schedule **shorter meetings**. 
> 	- Meetings tend to *expand* to the time allotted to them, so try to *get more done* in a *shorter amount* of time.
>     
> - Set aside time to **prepare** for the *meeting*. 
> 	- Read the necessary materials, review the agenda, and come ready to participate.

### During the meeting

>[!important]
>- At the beginning of the meeting, clearly state the **meeting goals**. 
>	- Stick to the **agenda** throughout the meeting to *avoid getting derailed*. 
>	- For recurring meetings, review the action items from the previous meeting to ensure accountability. 
>     
> - Encourage participants to put phones and laptops *away* during meetings and silence notifications, if possible.
>     
> - Practice and demonstrate **active listening**. 
> 	- Respond *verbally* (e.g., “That makes sense. Tell us more.”) and *non-verbally* (through head nodding and eye contact) to show engagement.  
>     
> - Encourage participation and **give everyone a chance to speak**, including remote participants. 
> 	- Ask open-ended questions like, “What does everyone think?” instead of “Does everyone agree?”
>     
> - Help everyone relax and feel more comfortable by starting meetings with *open-ended, personal questions* like, “How was your weekend?”
>     
> - Capture 
> 	- **key points**, 
> 	- **action items**, 
> 	- and **decisions** from the meeting, 
> 	- and **assign action items** to the *appropriate meeting participants*.


### After the meeting

>[!important]
>- **Recap** 
>	- **key decisions**, 
>	- **action items**, 
>	- **timelines**, 
>	- and **notes** and send out to participants.
>     
> - Schedule necessary **follow-up meetings** with relevant context.
>     
> - Assess the **need** for and **frequency** of recurring meetings. 
> 	- Schedule meetings *less frequently*, if possible.
