## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Initiation Cost Benefit Analysis

>[!quote] 
> Proper **initiation** also helps ensure that the **benefits** of the project
> outcomes will **outweigh** the **costs** of the project.
> 
> To determine this, you'll do what's called a **cost benefit analysis**, which is the process of *adding up the expected value* of a project (the benefits) and comparing them to the *dollar costs*.
> 
> To do this, you will work with stakeholders to consider a few questions. To determine the benefits of a project, those questions might include:
> 
>**Benefits** 
>- What *value* will this project create?
> 
>- How much *money* could this project *save* our organization?
> 
>- How much money will it *bring in* from *existing customers*?
> 
>- How much *time* will be saved?
> 
>- How will the *user experience* be improved? And to determine the costs of the project, those questions might include:
>
>
>**Costs**: 
>- How much time will people have to *spend* on this project?
> 
>- What will be the *one-time costs*?
> 
>- Are there any *ongoing costs*?
> 
>- What about *long-term costs*?
> 
>The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs, so it's really important that you consider these questions early on.
