>- **Scope**
>	- the project scope
>- **Cost**
>	- the *budget*

>
>These three restrictions are linked.

## Explanation


>[!info]
>Project managers may refer to the **triple constraint model** to manage scope and control *scope creep*. 
>-  It can serve as a valuable tool to help you negotiate priorities and consider trade-offs.
>

>[!quote]
>It's important to consider what **trade-offs** you're willing to make as the project progresses.
>- To do this successfully, you need a clear *understanding* of the project **priorities**. 
>- You have to know what is most important when it comes to scope, time, and cost.

>Remember, *change is inevitable* when managing projects, and understanding this framework can set you up to *plan and communicate* accordingly so your project will succeed.
