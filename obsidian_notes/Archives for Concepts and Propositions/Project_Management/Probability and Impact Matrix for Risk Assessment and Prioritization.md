### Probability and Impact Matrix

>[!important] Definition
>A **probability and impact matrix** is a tool used to *prioritize project risks* and identify the *risk exposure*.
>- **Impact** refers to the damage a risk could cause if it occurs.
>	- Impact is also determined on a scale of *high*, *medium*, and *low*.
>	- *High* means that if the risk occurs, it will substantially alter the project.
>	- *Low* means if the risk occurs, it will have a slight impact but it's not likely to derail the project.
>- **Probability** is the likelihood that a risk will occur.
>	- We also determine probability on a scale of *high*, *medium*, and *low*.
>- **Inherent risk** is the measure of a risk calculated by its *probability* and *impact*.
>	- Inherent risk is also determined on a *high*, *medium*, and *low* scale
