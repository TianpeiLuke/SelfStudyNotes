>The **Gantt chart** is one of the most popular tracking methods and can be used for all types of projects. 
>
>Gantt charts typically live in your *project plan* and are updated as the *project progresses*.
> 
> Gantt charts are useful for:
> 
> - Helping a team *stay on schedule*
>     
> - Projects with lots of *tasks*, *dependencies*, and *milestones*
>     
> - Projects with large teams, because *ownership* and *responsibilities* are explicitly laid out visually

### Roadmaps

>[!quote]
>**Roadmaps** are another common tracking method. 
>- Like Gantt charts, Roadmaps also track both individual and project progress toward milestones. 
>- However, Roadmaps are best suited for tracking *big milestones* in your project. 
> 
> Roadmaps are useful for:
> 
> - *High-level tracking* of *large milestones*. 
> 	- Roadmaps outline the project as a whole and provide an overall snapshot of key points—just like an actual roadmap contains points of interest and mile markers. 
>     
> - Illustrating to your team or *key stakeholders* how a project should *evolve over time*
> 

>[!info]
>A **roadmap** might list 
>- your project's **goals** at the *top* 
>- and a **description** of the **approach** we'll be taking to meet those goals.
>  
>A roadmap also includes 
>- a **high-level project overview**. 
>	- *High-level* in this context means a concise summary, usually three-to-four sentences, to clearly state 
>		- the **objectives** 
>		- and **priorities** for your project.
>- Below the goals, approach, and overview is a **table** that maps out what the **process** will entail.  



### Burndown charts

>[!quote]
>**Burndown charts** are typically used by **Agile Scrum teams**. 
>- Burndown charts reveal how quickly your team is working by displaying 
>	- how much work is *left* 
>	- and how much time *remains to complete* the work. 
>- The main uses of a Burndown chart are to keep the project team on top of *targeted completion dates* and make them aware of *scope creep* if it occurs. 
>	- The chart should be displayed so everyone can see it and needs to be updated regularly in order to be effective.
> 
> Burndown charts are useful for:
> 
> - Projects that require a *detailed review* of tasks
>     
> - Projects where *finishing on time* is the top priority

- [[Scrum Approach for Agile Project Management]]

>[!quote]
>A **Burndown chart** helps you, as a project manager, understand *how your team works* and *what influences* their ability to complete tasks on time. 
>- This way, you can *address issues right away*, before they become major problems. 
>- They also help you plan *more efficiently* for the next project by identifying potential problem areas.
