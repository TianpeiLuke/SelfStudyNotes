>[!important] Definition
>A **risk management plan** is a *living document* that contains information regarding
>-  *high-level risks* 
>- and the *mitigation plan* for each of those risks.

>[!info]
>This plan helps ensure that teammates and stakeholders have a *clear understanding of potential problems* and a *plan to address* them should they occur.

>[!info]
>Risk management is an **ongoing practice** that you'll take part in throughout the *planning* and *execution* of a project.

>[!info]
>Risk management plan should be **updated regularly** to 
>- *add* newly-identified risks, 
>- *remove* risks that are no longer relevant,
>- and *include any changes* in the *mitigation plans*.

>- the name of the company, and the name of the project
>- the document author
>- *document status*
>- *created date*

>- **risk register**
>	- a table or a chart that contains your list of possible risks.
>	- include

>		- **Risk Rating**
>		- **Mitigation plan**
>	- Use *probability and impact matrix* to assign the *inherent risk rating*

>*Share* to team and stakeholders to reach alignment.

### Communicating with Stakeholder

>[!quote] 
> it's not enough for you and your teammates to simply be aware of the biggest risks to a project.
> 
> You also need to **communicate these risks to your project stakeholders**, whether through documentation, e-mail, meetings, or other forms of communication you've deemed appropriate.

>[!info]
>if you don't tell your stakeholders about important risks, they may be *less equipped to help* you if an issue does arise.

>[!important]
>*Failing to communicate* can **erode that trust** in you as a leader of the project.

>[!quote]
>They'll likely want to know *if you were aware* of the possibility that this risk could occur, and they might wonder *why you didn't share* this information with them sooner.


>[!important]
>It's important to **communicate early and often** with stakeholders about medium- and high-level risks. 
>- **sets expectations** with stakeholders about what to potentially expect during the project execution phase 
>- *demonstrates* that you've taken steps to *mitigate and plan for those risks* should they come up.
>- gives you the opportunity to suggest ways they *might be able to help* you if a risk does arise.

### How to Communicate

>[!important]
>How do you communicate risks to stakeholders during the planning phase depends on the **severity** of the **identified risk**.
>- For **low-level risks**, 
>	- something as simple as an e-mail might suffice
>	- you might *list* a few low-level risks that are relevant to their interests and *briefly explain how* you'll address these risks if they arise.
>- For **medium level risks**,
>	- you might increase your level of communication to a direct e-mail between yourself and the stakeholder in which you 
>		- *outline the risk* with more specifics 
>		- and provide a *detailed explanation* of your plan to mitigate the risk.
>	- You might also link to your *risk management plan* to provide them with more information.
>	- You might *write "urgent" in the subject line* to stress the e-mail's importance.
>- For **high level risks**,
>	- requires a *thorough and direct level* of communication.
>	- add an *agenda item* to present *serious risks* and your *plans* to *mitigate* these risks.
>	- collect *feedback* on your risk management plan and *ask for insights* from stakeholders on how they suggest handling these high-level risks
