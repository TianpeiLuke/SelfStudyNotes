>[!important] Definition
>**Time and materials contracts** are usually paid for monthly based on the hours worked and other fees associated with the work, like travel and meals.

### Cost Control

>[!important] Definition
>**Cost control** is a practice where a project manager identifies factors that might impact their budget and then *creates effective actions* to minimize variances.

>[!info]
>It is much better to be **proactive** with your budget than to be *reactive* with your budget.

>[!info]
>- you shouldn't approve a new cost or item if it *hasn't been agreed upon* or if it isn't within the scope,  
>- you shouldn't be spending money if it's *not pre-approved* by your stakeholder or project sponsor.

### Suggestions for Budget Control

>[!important]
>- Establish a **sign off plan** and **inform** the appropriate stakeholders of any *changes* that occur.
>- **Manage changes** as they are made
>	- Update forecast and estimates
>	- Tracking everything
>- Accept that **budget misses** *will happen*
>	- It's your job to bring the expected cost overruns *within acceptable limits*.
>- Adequately **account for**, **adapt**, and *manage* your budget with the risk of **under-budget** in mind
