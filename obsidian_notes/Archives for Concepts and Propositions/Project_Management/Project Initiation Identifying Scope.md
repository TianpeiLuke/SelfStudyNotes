## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Initiation Identifying Scope

![[Project Initiation Key Components#^c69f9c]]

- [[Project Initiation Key Components]]

### Defining Project Scope

>[!important] Definition
>The **project scope** includes the *boundaries* of a project.
>- It helps to 
>	- identify necessary *resources*, 
>	- *resource costs*, 
>	- and a *schedule* for the project
>
>A clearly defined **scope** describes all the *details* of a project and *regulates* what can be added or removed as it progresses.
>- The job of product manager is to **monitor** the project's scope and **protect** it at all costs.

>[!info]
>- Talk to stakeholders to understand their goals, 
>	- to find out what *is* and *is not* included
>- Define the scope at *initial planning phase*.
>	- Make sure everyone *agree* to the same expectation
>	- Mitigate the *risk of big changes* down the line.
>- *Document* the details in scope for reference

### Asking scope-defining questions

>[!quote]
>Here are a few more helpful questions to add to the list.
>- **Where** did the project *come from*?
>- **Why** is it *needed*? 
>- **What** is the project expected to achieve?
>- What does the project **sponsor** have in mind?
>- **Who** *approves* the final results?


>[!example] Question
> -  **Stakeholders**
> 
> 	- How did you arrive at the decision to update the dining space?
>     
> 	- Did the request originate from the restaurant owner, customers, or other stakeholders?
>     
> 	- Who will approve the scope for the project?
>     
> 
> - **Goals**
> 
> 	- What is the reason for updating the dining space?
>     
> 	- What isn't working in the current dining space?
>     
> 	- What is the end goal of this project?
>     
> 
> - **Deliverables**
> 
> 	- Which dining space is being updated?
>     
> 	- What exactly needs to be updated?
>     
> 	- Does the dining space need a remodel?
>     
> 
> - **Resources**
> 
> 	- What materials, equipment, and people will be needed?
>     
> 	- Will we need to hire contractors?
>     
> 	- Will we need to attain a floor plan and building permits?
>     
> 
> - **Budget**
> 
> 	- What is the budget for this project? Is it fixed or flexible?
>     
> 
> - **Schedule**
> 
> 	- How much time do we have to complete the project?
>     
> 	- When does the project need to be completed?
>     
> 
> - **Flexibility**
> 
> 	- How much flexibility is there?
>     
> 	- What is the highest priority: hitting the deadline, sticking to the budget, or making sure the result meets all the quality targets?

### Monitoring and Maintaining Project Scope

>[!important] Definition
>- **in-scope tasks**: 
>	- Tasks that are included in the *project plan* and contribute to the *project goal*
>- **out-of-scope tasks**:
>	-  Tasks that are *not* included in the *project plan* and *don't* contribute to the *project goal*

>[!quote]
>It's your job as a project manager to **set and maintain** firm *boundaries* for your project so that your team can stay on track.

### Scope Creep

>[!important] Definition
>**Scope creep** refers to 
>- changes, 
>- growth, 
>- and uncontrolled factors
>
>that affect a *project scope* at any point *after the project begins*.

>[!info]
>Sources of **scope creep**:
>- **External**:
>	- change of customer request
>	- shift of business environment
>	- change of technology 
>- **Internal**:
>	- comes from members of the project team who suggest or insists on the process or product change or improvement.

### Triple Constraint Model

>[!important]
>The **triple constraint model** is the combination of the three most significant restrictions of any project:
>- **Scope**
>	- the project scope
>- **Cost**
>	- the *budget*
>	- the *resources*
>	- the *people*
>- **Time**: 
>	- the *project schedule* and *deadlines*
>

![[triple_constraint_model.scope.png]]

>[!info]
>Project managers may refer to the **triple constraint model** to manage scope and control *scope creep*. 
>-  It can serve as a valuable tool to help you negotiate priorities and consider trade-offs.

### Scope Management Best Practice

>[!quote]
>Here are some best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep: 
> 
> - **Define your project’s requirements.**
> 	- *Communicate* with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project 
> 	- and *document those requirements* during the initiation phase. 
>     
> - **Set a clear project schedule.** 
> 	- *Time and task management* are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. 
> 	- Your schedule should outline all of your project’s *requirements* and the *tasks* that are *necessary* to achieve them.
>     
> - **Determine what is out of scope.** 
> 	- Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team *understand* when proposed changes are *out of scope*. 
> 	- Come to a *clear agreement* about the *potential impacts* to the project and document your agreement. 
>     
> - **Provide** **alternatives.** 
> 	- Suggest *alternative solutions* to your customer or stakeholder. 
> 	- You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. 
> 	- Perform a *cost-benefit analysis*, if necessary.
>     
> - **Set up a change control process.** 
> 	- During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. 
> 	- Determine the *process* for how each change will be *defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected)* before you add it to your project plan. 
> 	- Make sure your project team is aware of this process.
>     
> - **Learn how to say no.** 
> 	- Sometimes you will have to *say no to proposed changes*. 
> 	- Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. 
> 	- If you are asked to take on additional tasks, *explain* how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. 
>     
> - **Collect** **costs for out-of-scope work.** 
> 	- If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to *document all costs incurred.* 
> 	- That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the *increased scope*. 
> 	- Be sure to indicate what the charges are for.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
> While you can't control everything that happens, there are some useful tips to keep in mind.
> 
>- First, make sure the **stakeholders have visibility** into the project. 
>	- You want them to know the details of what's going to be produced, what resources are required, how much it will cost, and how much time it'll take. 
>- Also, get clarity on the **requirements** and ask for constructive criticism of the initial product proposal. 
>	- It's important to get this information *before any contracts are signed*.
> 
>- Be sure to set ground **rules and expectations** for stakeholder involvement once the project gets started. 
>	- Come to an agreement on each of your *roles and responsibilities* during execution and status reviews.
> 
>- Once you're clear on the project scope, come up with a **plan** for how to **deal with out-of-scope requests**.
>	- Agree on *who* can make formal change requests and how those requests will be *evaluated*, *accepted*, and *performed*.
> 
>- And finally, be sure to get these **agreements in writing**.
>	- This way, you'll always have *documentation* to point if you, a stakeholder, or the customer have a *disagreement* down the line.
>
>One of leading cause of external scope creep is *not clear on requirement* before defining the scope and getting approval. .. This is where those **specific and measurable goals** and **deliverables** come into play. 
>- If the requirements aren't specific and if you haven't agreed on the project's processes, deliverables, and milestones, then you're almost guaranteed to be dealing with scope creep once the project begins

>[!quote]
>What you need to make clear to your team is that any change outside of the project scope comes off the bottom line, threatens the schedule, and increases risk.
>- There are **no small impacts** to *project scope*.
>- Any time a team member takes on an unplanned task, more is lost than just the time spent working on that task.
>
>It's your responsibility as the project manager to *maintain the limits of the project*.
>- The best defense is to **know the details** of your project in and out so you're always *prepared* with the most appropriate *response* to a new idea or request.
