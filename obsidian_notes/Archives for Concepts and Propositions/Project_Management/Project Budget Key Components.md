### Key Factors in Budgeting


>[!important] 
>Some important *factors* to consider during the **budgeting process** include
>- **resource cost rates**
>	- *cost of resource*
>	- Some examples of resources are labor, tools, equipment, materials, and software.
>- **reserve analysis**
>	- A **reserve analysis** is a method to check for *remaining project resources*.
>	- review all potential risks to your project and determine if you need to add **buffer funds**.
>- **contingency budget**
>	- **Contingency budget** in the context of project management, is money that is included to cover *potentially unforeseen events* that aren't accounted for in a cost estimate.
>	- The purpose is to compensate for the uncertainty that occurs in cost and time estimates, as well as unpredictable risk exposure.
>- **cost of quality**
>	-  all of the costs that are incurred to prevent issues with products, processes, or tasks.

### Perform a reserve analysis

>[!important] Definition
>A **reserve analysis** will help you account for any *buffer funds* you may need. 
>- First, review all *potential risks* to your project and determine if you need to add buffer funds, also referred to as a **contingency budget**. 
>	- These funds are necessary because new costs that you did not expect are likely to happen throughout the project.

>[!important]
>- Also, we may account for **cost of quality** in your overall project budget.
>	- The **cost of quality** refers to all of the costs that are incurred to deliver a *quality* product or service, which can extend beyond material resources.
>	- One example would be having to redesign a product or service due to **defects**. 
>		- A **defect** could mean *refunds* to customers, time and money required to create a new product or service, and multiple other potential costs affecting the client.
