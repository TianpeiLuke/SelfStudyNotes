## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Initiation Measuring Success as Project Launch and Landing

![[Project Initiation Key Components#^c69f9c]]

- [[Project Initiation Key Components]]

### Project Launch

>[!important] Definition
>*Delivering the final result* of your project to the client or user is what's called a **project launch**.

### Project Landing

>[!important] Definition
>**Landing** is when you actually *meet* the *success criteria* established at the beginning of the project.
>
>*Landing* is based on
>- the **success criteria**
>- and the *metrics* you defined initially when setting *SMART goals*.

>[!quote]
>This is a **crucial part** of **goal setting** that is often overlooked in the initiation phase.
>- For example, think about taking a trip on an airplane. It's not enough for the pilot to be able to get the plane off the ground. To arrive safely at your destination, they've got to know how to land.
>- Your success has to *continue beyond* the point of delivering the final project.
>- You need to be able to *measure* whether the project *functions as intended* once it's put into practice.

>[!quote]
>For most projects, a *launch itself isn't a meaningful measure of success*. 
>
>It's what comes *after the launch* that really counts.
>- **Launches** are only a *means to an end*, and 
>- **looking beyond the launch** is important to ensure the launch achieves your overall goals.

>[!info]
>The **success criteria** is used to determine if the **landing** is achieved.

>[!important] Definition
>**Launch First, Land Later**: 
>- After the initial launch, the team need to *check regularly* in order to make sure the **project landing**

### Common Mistakes

>[!quote]
>A common mistake of many project teams is to “**launch and forget**” the results. 
>- This happens when a project manager *delivers* the project to the client and the client accepts the project delivery, but the project manager *doesn’t assess* if the project deliverables *satisfy the customer or user.* 
>- **Launching** and **landings** work in tandem to ensure *true success*. 
>
>A **project landing** *shouldn’t create more hurdles*. 
>- If done correctly, a landing creates *greater alignment* within the teams on the end results you all desire, 
>- and it gives everybody on the team *better visibility* on how to achieve success.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>You will often hear companies celebrating the **launch** of a new product, service, or initiative, and it is important to remember that even when your project is out in the world, your *work isn’t complete*. 
>- When working on a project, the **goal** *isn’t simply to launch* it, but to **land** it. 
>
>**Landings** occur once your project *achieves* a measure of success. 
>- As project managers, **landings** are *what we strive for* and *what we celebrate*. They are the ultimate reward for all of our efforts.
