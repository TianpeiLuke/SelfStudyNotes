## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Execution Data Analysis and Steps

>[!important] Definition
>**Data analysis** is the process of *collecting* and *organizing* information to help
>- draw conclusions, 
>- solve problems, 
>- make informed decisions, 
>- and support your goals.

>[!important] Definition
>- **Quantitative data** includes statistical and numerical facts about the number of rider requests that came in.
>- **Qualitative data** describes the subjective qualities or things that can't be measured with numerical data,


>[!important] Definition
>There are six main steps involved in data analysis: 
>- **Ask**
>	- During the **Ask** phase, ask key questions to help *frame your analysis*, 
>		- starting with: 
>			- What is the problem? 
>			- When defining the problem, 
>			- look at the current state of the business and identify how it is different from the ideal state.
>		- Usually, there is an *obstacle* in the way or something wrong that *needs to be fixed*.  
>		- At this stage, you want to be as *specific* as possible. 
>		- You also want to *stay focused* on the *problem itself*, not just the symptoms.
>	- Another part of the **Ask** stage is *identifying your stakeholders* and *understanding their expectations*.
>		- It is pretty common for a stakeholder to come to you with a problem that needs solving. 
>		- But *before* you begin your analysis, you need to be clear about *what they are asking of you*.
>- **Prepare**
>	- This is where you *collect and store* the data you will use for the upcoming analysis process.
>- **Process** 
>	- In this step, you will “*clean*” your data, which means you will
>		- *enter* your data into a spreadsheet, or another tool of your choice, 
>		- and *eliminate* any inconsistencies and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results.
>		- While collecting data, be sure to get rid of any *duplicate* responses or biased data. 
>		- This helps you know that any decisions made from the analysis are based on facts and that they are fair and *unbiased*.
>- **Analyze** 
>	- In this stage, you take a close look at your data to *draw conclusions*, *make predictions*, and *decide on next steps*.
>	- Here, you will transform and organize the data in a way that highlights the full scope of the results so you can figure out what it all means. 
>	- You can create *visualizations* using charts and graphs to determine if there are any trends or patterns within the data or any need for additional research.
>- **Share** 
>	- In this stage, you use **data visualization** to organize your data in a format that is clear and digestible for your audience. 
>	- When sharing, you can offer the insights you gained during your analysis to help stakeholders make effective, *data-driven decisions* for solving the problem.
>- **Act**
>	- the business takes all of the insights you have provided and puts them into action to solve the original business problem.
