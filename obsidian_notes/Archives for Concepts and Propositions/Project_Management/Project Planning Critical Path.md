### Critical Path

>[!important] Definition
>The **critical path** refers to 
>- the *list* of *project milestones* that you *must reach* in order to meet the project goal *on schedule*, 
>- as well as the *mandatory tasks* that contribute to the completion of *each milestone*. 
>
>Anything else is considered *off the critical path*.

>[!important]
>**Critical path** includes the **bare minimum** *number of tasks and milestones* you need to reach your project goal.
>- If your team is unable to complete any of those tasks on time, that might result in a *project delay*.

### Determine Critical Path

>[!quote]
>To determine the critical path of a project, 
>- you'd start by **listing all the tasks** *required* to complete the project and the *milestones* they feed into.
>	- This is a perfect time to think back to your **work breakdown structure, or WBS**, which is a chart that sorts *all the milestones and tasks* of a project into a hierarchy according to the order in which they need to be completed.
>	- This includes a detailed overview of every project task.
>- Then, you **determine which tasks** on the list **absolutely can't begin** until another task is complete.
>	- This is called a **dependency**,
>- Next, you'll work with your team to **make time estimates** for *each task*, and *map* each task from start to finish.
>	- The *longest path* is your **critical path**.
