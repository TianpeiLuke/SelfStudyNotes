>	- *what problem* are you trying to solve
>	- what are the project *goals*
>	- what are the *scope* and *deliverables*, and 
>	- who are the project's *stakeholder*
>	- what *resources* do they need to complete their work?
>- It *preserves* decisions made early on in the project

### Project Proposals

### Project Charters

![[Project Initiation Project Charter#^361357]]

- [[Project Initiation Project Charter]]

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>- A **project proposal** is created *earlier* in the project life cycle than the **project charter**.
>- The **proposal** *kicks off* the initiation phase by influencing and persuading the company to move forward with the project.
>- **Project charter**'s goal is to more clearly *define* the *key details* of the project.
>- Another difference between these two documents is that a **charter** will often serve as a point of **reference** *throughout* the life of a project.
>- The project charter serves a similar purpose and often comes at the *end of the initiation phase*, while the proposal is at the *earlier stage*.
