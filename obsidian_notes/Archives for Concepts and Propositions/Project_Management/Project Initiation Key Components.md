### Key Components

>[!important] Definition
>The **key components** for project initiation include
>- **Goals**: what you've been *asked to do* and what you're trying to *achieve*.
>	- All projects should have clear goals.
>- **Scope**: the process to define the *work that needs to happen* to complete the project.
>- **Deliverables**:  the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor.
>	- Deliverables can be anything from product *features* and *functionalities* to *documentation*, *processes* and more, anything that *enables the goal* of your project to be achieved.
>	- Deliverables are submitted to help you *reach your project goals*.
>	- Deliverables can be **tangible** or **intangible**
>- **Success Criteria**: the *standards* by which you *measure* *how successful* a project was in reaching its goals.
>- **Stakeholders**:  the people who both have an *interest* in and *are affected* by the completion and success of a project.
>	- They are key to making informed decisions at *every step* of the project.
>	- They are *instrumental* in determining the goals, objectives, deliverables and success criteria of the project
>- and **Resources**: generally refer to 
>	- the *budget*, 
>	- *people*, 
>	- *materials*, 
>	- and other items that you will have at your disposal.

### Project Charter

>[!important] Definition
>A **project charter** is a document that contains all the details of the project. 
>- Project charters clearly *define the project* and its *goals* and *outline what is needed* to accomplish them.
>- A project charter allows you to *get organized*, set up a *framework* for what needs to be done and *communicate* those details to others.
>- Draft the project charter and *review with stakeholder*.
>- Get *approval* from stakeholder to move on to the next phase.
