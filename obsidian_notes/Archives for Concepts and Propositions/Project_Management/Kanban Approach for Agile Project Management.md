## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Kanban Approach for Agile Project Management


>[!important] Definition
>**Kanban boards** are a visual tool used to manage tasks and workflows. 
>- Kanban boards can be created on whiteboards, magnetic boards, poster boards, computer programs, and more. 
>- *Tasks* associated with the project are written on **cards**. 
>- These cards are placed in *columns*, which represent the *progress* made.
>
>Kanban board is mainly used in **Agile project management**

### Purposes of a Kanban board

>[!important] 
> **Kanban boards** are used to:
> 
> - Give a quick *visual understanding* of work details and provide *critical task information*.
>     
> - Facilitate *handoffs* between *stakeholders*, such as between development and testing resources or between team members who work on related tasks.
>     
> - Help with *capturing metrics* and improving workflows.

### Using a Kanban board

>[!important]
>The key elements of *Kanban board* include
>- **tasks**
>	- Each *colored rectangle* (**card**) is associated with a task
>	- The tasks are represented *horizontally* across the *effort timeline*.
>- **status**
>	- Each column represents where the task is in relation to its completion.
>	- As a task is started, it move from one column to anther column on the right
>- **dates**
>- **durations**

### Creating cards

>[!quote]
>Cards will vary in style—you can even use sticky notes on a whiteboard—but most cards will contain a few key details about the task that they represent. When using physical cards, teams often use both sides. 

>[!important]
>Here is what both sides of the card should include:
>- **Front**
> 
> 	- **Title and unique identifier:** 
> 		- Make sure you have a *quick reference* for tasks and ID numbers.
>     
> 	- **Description of work:** 
> 		- Briefly describe the task to be accomplished. 
> 		- Remember that this is intended to be captured on something *no larger than an index card*.
>     
> 	- **Estimation of effort:** 
> 		- *Estimate the amount of work* it will take to complete the task. 
> 		- For example, you can write “small,” “medium,” or “large” to indicate the level of effort you think that task will involve. 
>     
> 	- **Who is assigned to the task:** 
> 		- Indicate *who is responsible* for completing the task;
> 		- ideally, *one person per card*.
>     
> 
>- **Back** 
> 
> 	- **Start date:** 
> 		- Include the *start date* of the task for use in metrics, tracking, and ensuring that your time estimate is accurate.
>     
> 	- **Blocked days:** 
> 		- Indicate which days your task may be *halted*. 
> 		- A task can become blocked if it *can’t continue* to be worked on. 
> 		- For example, if you were supposed to receive a deliverable and it hasn’t been delivered yet, then your day may be blocked for this particular task.
>     
> 	- **Finish date:** 
> 		- As with any plan, it is important to track when the task is *supposed to be finished*. 
> 		- This allows you to ensure that your project is still *on track* to reach the end goal.
