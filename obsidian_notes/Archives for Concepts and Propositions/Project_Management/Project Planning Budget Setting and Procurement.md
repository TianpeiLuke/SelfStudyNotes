### Best Practice for Project Budgeting

>[!important]
>Here are a few tips to consider when creating your project budget:
> 
> - **Reference historical data:** Your project may be similar to a previous project your organization has worked on. It is important to review how that project’s budget was handled, find out what went well, and learn from any previous mistakes.
>     
> - **Utilize your team, mentors, or manager:** Get into the habit of asking for your team to double check your work to give you additional sets of eyes on your documents.
>     
> - **Time-phase** **your budget**: Time-phased budgeting allows you to allocate costs for project tasks over the projected timeline in which those expenses are planned to take place. By looking at your tasks against a timeline, you can track and compare planned versus actual costs over time and manage changes to your budget as necessary.
>     
> - **Check, check, and double check:** Make sure that your budget is accurate and error-free. Your budget will likely require approval from another department, such as finance or senior management, so do your best to ensure that it is as straightforward to understand as possible and that all of your calculations are correct.

### Develop a baseline budget

>[!important] Definition
>A **baseline budget** is an estimate of project costs that you *start* with *at the beginning* of your project
>- Once you have created a budget for your project and gotten it approved, you should **publish this baseline** and use it to compare against *actual performance progress*. 
>- This will give you insight into how your project budget is doing and allow you to make informed adjustments.

>[!important] Definition
>It is important to **continually monitor** your project budget and make changes if necessary. 
>- Be aware that budget updates can require the same approvals as your initial budget. 
>- Also, you should “**re-baseline**” **your budget** if you make significant changes. 
>	- **Re-baselining** refers to when you update or modify a project's baseline as a result of any approved change to the schedule, cost, or deliverable content. 
>	- For example, if you have a significant change in your project scope, your budget will likely be impacted. In this instance, you would need to re-baseline in order to adhere to a realistic budget.
