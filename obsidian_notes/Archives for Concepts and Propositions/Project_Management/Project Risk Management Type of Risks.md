## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Project Risk Management Type of Risks

![[Project Initiation Identifying Scope#^68fd9d]]

>[!important] Definition
>Common type of risks inclue
>- **Time Risks**
>	- Time risks refers to the possibility that project tasks will take *longer than anticipated* to complete.
>- **Budget Risks**
>	- Budget risk refers to the possibility that the *cost* of a project will *increase* due to poor planning or expanding the project scope.
>	- budgeting provides the basis for project costs control.
>	- some reputational damage for the company.
>- **Scope Risks**
>	- Scope risk refers to the possibility that a *project* *won't produce* the results outlined in the project *goals*.
>- **External Risks**
>	- refers to risks that result from factors *outside* of the company that you have little to no control over.
>	- **Legal Risk**
>	- **Environmental Risk**

### Single Point of Failure

>[!important] Definition
>A **single point of failure** is a risk that has the potential to be catastrophic and halt work across a project.
>- no one can make progress on their tasks until the issue is resolved.

>[!quote]
>For example, a lot of projects use **subject matter experts** (**SMEs**)—team members with a deep understanding of a particular job, process, department, function, technology, machine, material, or type of equipment. 
>- SMEs are involved to advise you throughout the project life cycle. 
>- *Having only one SME* familiar with a critical system on your team is an example of a **single point of failure risk**. 
>- This SME will only offer one perspective, and if they are the only person advising on the system, there is no one to offer another perspective.

### Dependency

>[!important] Definition
>A **dependency** is a relationship between two project tasks, where the start or completion of one *depends* on the start or completion of the *other*.
>- **Dependencies** are like links that connect one project task to another.
>- A dependency *must be addressed before* the task can be completed or before another task can begin.
>- Because dependencies are the links that connect one project task to another, they are often a *huge source of risk* to a project.

>[!info]
>If you don't **plan for dependencies**, you might risk and impact your *budget schedule* or project outcome.

>[!important] Definition
>There are two types of dependencies: **internal** and **external**.
>-  **Internal dependencies** refer to dependencies within the project that you and your team *have control* over.
>- **External dependencies** are dependencies that you have *no control over*.

#### Types of Dependency

>[!important] Definition
>**Dependencies** are a relationship between two project tasks in which the *completion* or the initiation of one is reliant on the completion or initiation of the other. 
>
>Let’s explore four common types of dependencies:
>- **Finish to Start (FS)**
>	- In this type of relationship between two tasks, Task A *must be completed before* Task B can *start*.
>- **Finish to Finish (FF)**
>	- In this model, Task A *must finish before* Task B can *finish*. 
>	- This type of dependency is *not common*.
>- **Start to Start (SS)**
>	- In this model, Task B *can’t begin until* Task A *begins*. 
>	- This means Tasks A and B *start at the same time* and run in parallel.
>- **Start to Finish (SF)**
>	- In this model, Task A *must begin before* Task B can be *completed*.

#### Dependency graphs

>[!info]
>As a project manager, you will use these dependencies to visually represent the flow of work during your project via **dependency graph**
