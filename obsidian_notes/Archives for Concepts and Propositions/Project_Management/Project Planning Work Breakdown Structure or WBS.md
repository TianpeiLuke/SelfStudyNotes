### Steps to build a WBS

>[!quote] 
> As a reminder, here are *three main steps* to follow when creating a WBS: 
> 
> - **Start with the high-level, overarching project picture. Brainstorm with your team to list the major deliverables and milestones.** 
> 	- Example: Imagine you are planning a company event. Your major milestones might include categories like “secure venue,”  “finalize guest logistics,” and “establish agenda.”
>     
> 
> - **Identify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones.** 
> 	- Example: You could break a milestone like “secure venue” down into tasks like “research venues,” “tour and decorate space,” “make down payment,” and so on. 
>     
> 
> - **Examine those tasks and break them down further into sub-tasks.** 
> 	- Example: You could break down a task like “tour and decorate space” further into sub-tasks like “organize decorating committee,” “purchase decorations,” “assign decorating responsibilities,” and so on.
