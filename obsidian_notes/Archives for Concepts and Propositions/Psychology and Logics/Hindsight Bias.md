## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Hindsight Bias
>
>**Hindsight bias**, also known as the **knew-it-all-along phenomenon** [^1] or **creeping determinism**,[^2] is the common tendency for people to perceive past events as having been more predictable than they were. [^3] [^4]


## Explanation

>[!info]
>**After an event has occurred**, people often believe that they *would have predicted* or perhaps even *would have known* with *a high degree of certainty* what the outcome of the event would have been before the event occurred. 
>
>Hindsight bias may **cause distortions of memories** of what was known or believed before an event occurred, and is a significant source of [**overconfidence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect "Overconfidence effect") regarding an individual's ability to predict the outcomes of future events.[^5]

>The hindsight bias is one of the most prevailing fallacies of all. We can aptly describe it as the *"I told you so"* phenomenon: **In retrospect, everything seems clear and inevitable.** ... Every child learns this historical detail in school. But back then, nobody would have dreamed of such an escalation. It would have sounded too absurd.

>So why is the hindsight bias so perilous? Well, *it makes us believe we are better predictors than we actually are, causing us to be arrogant about our knowledge and consequently to take too much risk*. And not just with global issues: "Have you heard? Sylvia and Chris aren't together anymore. It was always going to go wrong, they were just so different." Or: "They were just so similar." Or: "They spent too much time together." Or even: "They barely saw one another."

>*Overcoming the hindsight bias is not easy.* Studies have shown that people who are aware of it fall for it just as much as everyone else. So, I'm very sorry, but you've just wasted your time reading this chapter.

>If you're still with me, I have one final tip, this time from personal rather than professional experience: Keep a journal. Write down your predictions—for political changes, your career, your weight, the stock market, and so on. Then, from time to time, compare your notes with actual developments. You will be amazed at what a poor forecaster you are. Don't forget to read history, too—not the retrospective, compacted theories compiled in textbooks, but the diaries, oral histories, and historical documents from the period. If you can't live without news, read newspapers from five, ten, or twenty years ago. This will give you a much better sense of just how unpredictable the world is.

>Hindsight may provide *temporary comfort to those overwhelmed by complexity*, but as for providing deeper revelations about how the world works, you'll benefit by *looking elsewhere*.
