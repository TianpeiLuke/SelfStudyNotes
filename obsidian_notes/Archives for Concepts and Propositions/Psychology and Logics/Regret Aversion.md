## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Regret Aversion
>
>The theory of **regret aversion** or **anticipated regret** proposes that when facing a decision, individuals might _anticipate_ regret and thus incorporate in their choice their desire to *eliminate or reduce this possibility*. Regret is a [negative emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_affectivity "Negative affectivity") with a powerful social and [reputational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation "Reputation") component, and is central to how humans learn from experience and to the human psychology of [risk aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion "Risk aversion"). Conscious anticipation of regret creates a [feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback "Feedback") that transcends regret from the emotional realm—often modeled as mere [human behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior "Human behavior")—into the realm of the [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality") choice behavior that is modeled in decision theory.

>[!info]
>In [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory"), on making [decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice "Choice") under [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty "Uncertainty")—should information about the best course of action arrive _after_ taking a fixed decision—the human emotional response of **[regret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret "Regret")** is often experienced, and can be measured as the value of difference between a made decision and the optimal decision.
