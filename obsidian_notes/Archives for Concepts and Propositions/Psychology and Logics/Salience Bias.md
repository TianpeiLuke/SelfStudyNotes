## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Salience Bias
>
>**Salience bias** (also referred to as **perceptual salience**) is a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias "Cognitive bias") that predisposes individuals to **focus on** or **attend to** items, information, or stimuli that are **more prominent, visible**, [^1] or **emotionally striking**. This is as opposed to stimuli that are unremarkable, or less salient, even though this *difference is often irrelevant* by objective standards.[^2]
