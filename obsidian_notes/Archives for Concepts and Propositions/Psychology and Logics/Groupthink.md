## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Anchoring Effect
>
>**Groupthink** is a psychological [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon") that occurs within a [group of people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group "Social group") in which the desire for *harmony* or [**conformity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity "Conformity") in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making "Decision-making") outcome. *Cohesiveness*, or the desire for cohesiveness, in a group may produce a tendency among its members to **agree at all costs**.[^1] This causes the group to *minimize conflict and reach a consensus* decision without [critical evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking "Critical thinking").[^2] [^3]

>[!info]
>Groupthink is a construct of [social psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology "Social psychology") but has an extensive reach and influences literature in the fields of [communication studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_studies "Communication studies"), [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science"), [management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management "Management"), and [organizational theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_theory "Organizational theory"),[^4] as well as important aspects of deviant religious [cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult "Cult") behaviour.[^5] [^6]



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Psychology professor Irving Janis has studied many fiascoes. He concluded that they share the following pattern: Members of a *close-knit group* cultivate **team spirit** by (unconsciously) *building illusions*. One of these fantasies is a belief in invincibility: *"If both our leader [in this case, Kennedy] and the group are confident that the plan will work, then luck will be on our side."* Next comes **the illusion of unanimity**: If the others are of *the same opinion*, *any dissenting view must be wrong*. No one wants to be the naysayer that destroys team unity. Finally, each person is *happy to be part of the group*. Expressing *reservations could mean exclusion* from it. In our evolutionary past, such banishment guaranteed death; hence our strong urge to remain in the group's favor.

>If you ever find yourself in a *tight, unanimous group*, you must **speak your mind**, even if your team does not like it. Question *tacit assumptions*, even if you risk expulsion from the warm nest. And, if you *lead a group*, appoint someone as **devil's advocate**. She will not be the most popular member of the team, but she might be the most important.
