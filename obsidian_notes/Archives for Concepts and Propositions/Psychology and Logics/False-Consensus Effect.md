## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  False-Consensus Effect
>
>n [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), the **false consensus effect**, also known as **consensus bias**, is a pervasive [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias "Cognitive bias") that causes people to "*see their own* behavioral choices and judgments as *relatively common* and appropriate to existing circumstances".[^1] In other words, they *assume* that their personal qualities, characteristics, beliefs, and actions are *relatively widespread* through the general population.


## Explanation

>[!info]
>This false consensus is significant because it increases [self-esteem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem "Self-esteem") ([overconfidence effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect "Overconfidence effect")). It can be derived from a desire to conform and be liked by others in a [social environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment "Social environment"). This bias is especially prevalent in group settings where one thinks the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population. Since the members of a group reach a consensus and rarely encounter those who dispute it, they tend to believe that everybody thinks the same way. The false-consensus effect is not restricted to cases where people believe that their values are shared by the majority, but it still manifests as an overestimate of the extent of their belief.[^2]
