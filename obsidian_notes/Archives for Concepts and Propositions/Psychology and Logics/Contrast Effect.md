## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Contrast Effect
>
>A **contrast effect** is the enhancement or diminishment, *relative to normal*, of [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception"), [cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition "Cognition") or related performance as a result of *successive (immediately previous) or simultaneous exposure* to a [stimulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology) "Stimulus (physiology)") of lesser or greater value in the same dimension. (Here, normal perception, cognition or performance is that which would be obtained in the absence of the comparison stimulus—i.e., one based on all previous experience.)


## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Both of these stories epitomize the *contrast effect*: We *judge* something to be beautiful, expensive, or large *if* we have something ugly, cheap, or small *in front of us*. We have *difficulty with absolute judgments*. 
>
>The contrast effect is a common *misconception*. You order leather seats for your new car because, compared to the $60,000 price tag on the car, $3,000 seems a pittance. All industries that offer upgrade options exploit this illusion. 
>...
>
>Without the contrast effect, the *discount business* would be completely untenable.

>When we encounter contrasts, we react like birds to a gunshot. We jump up and get moving. Our weak spot: We don't notice small, gradual changes.
