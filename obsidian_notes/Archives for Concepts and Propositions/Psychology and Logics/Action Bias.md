## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Action Bias
>
>**Action bias** is the [psychological phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology") where people tend to **favor action over inaction**, even when there is no indication that doing so would point towards a better result. It is an [automatic response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaticity "Automaticity"), similar to a [reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex "Reflex") or an [impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response "Impulse response") and is not based on [rational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_thinking "Rational thinking"). One of the first appearances of the term "action bias" in [scientific journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal "Scientific journal") was in a 2000 paper by Patt and Zechenhauser titled "Action Bias and Environmental Decisions", where its relevance in [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics "Politics") was expounded.[^1]
