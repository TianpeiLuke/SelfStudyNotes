## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Slippery Slope
>
>In a **slippery slope argument**, *a course of action* is rejected because the slippery slope advocate believes it will lead to **a chain reaction** resulting in an *undesirable end* or ends.[^1] The core of the slippery slope argument is that *a specific decision* under debate is likely to result in [unintended consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences "Unintended consequences"). The *strength* of such an argument depends on whether *the small step* really is likely to lead to the effect. This is quantified in terms of what is known as the [warrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(rhetoric) "Warrant (rhetoric)") (in this case, a demonstration of the process that leads to the significant effect).
