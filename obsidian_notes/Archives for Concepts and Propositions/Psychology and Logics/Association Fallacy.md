## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Association Fallacy or *Guilt by Association* or *Honor by Association* 
>
>The **association fallacy** is a [formal logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy "Formal fallacy") that asserts that *properties* of one thing must also be properties of another thing, *if both things belong to the same group*.
>
>When it is an attempt to win favor by *exploiting* the audience's *preexisting spite or disdain* for something else, it is called **guilt by association** or an **appeal to spite** ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"): _argumentum ad odium_). [^1]  Guilt by association is similar to [ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem "Ad hominem") arguments which attack the speaker rather than addressing the claims, but in this case the ill feeling is not created by the argument; it already exists.



>[!important]
> Using the language of [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory"), the *formal fallacy* can be written as follows:
> 
> - **Premise:** $A$ is in set $S_1$
> - **Premise:** $A$ is in set $S_2$
> - **Premise:** $B$ is also in set $S_2$
> - **Conclusion:** Therefore, $B$ is in set $S_1$.

>[!important]
>In the notation of [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"), this type of *fallacy* can be expressed as 
>$$
>(\exists x \in S: \phi(x)) \Rightarrow (\forall x \in S: \phi(x)).
>$$
