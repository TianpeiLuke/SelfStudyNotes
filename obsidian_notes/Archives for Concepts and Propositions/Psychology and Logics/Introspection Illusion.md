## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Introspection Illusion
>
>The **introspection illusion** is a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias "Cognitive bias") in which people *wrongly think they have direct insight* into the origins of their mental states, while treating others' [introspections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection "Introspection") as *unreliable*. The illusion has been examined in [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological "Psychological") experiments, and suggested as a basis for biases in how people *compare themselves to others*. These experiments have been interpreted as suggesting that, rather than offering direct access to the processes underlying [mental states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_states "Mental states"), [introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection "Introspection") is a process of construction and [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference"), much as people indirectly infer others' [mental states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_states "Mental states") from their behaviour.[^1]

>[!info]
>When people mistake unreliable introspection for genuine self-knowledge, the result can be an [illusion of superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority "Illusory superiority") over other people, for example when each person thinks they are less biased and less conformist than the rest of the group.
