## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Sunk Cost
>
>In [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") and business [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making "Decision-making"), a **sunk cost** (also known as **retrospective cost**) is a [cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost "Cost") that has *already been incurred* and *cannot be recovered*.[^1] [^2] 

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Sunk Cost Fallacy
>
>Sunk costs often influence people's decisions, [^3] [^4] with people believing that **investments (i.e., sunk costs) justify further expenditures**.[^5] People demonstrate "a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made".[^6] [^7] This is the **sunk cost fallacy**, and such behavior may be described as "*throwing good money after bad*", [^4] [^8] while *refusing to succumb to* what may be described as "*cutting one's losses*". [^4]


## Explanation

>[!quote]
>The sunk cost fallacy is most dangerous when we have *invested a lot of time, money, energy, or love in something*. **This investment becomes a reason to carry on**, even if we are dealing with a lost cause. The more we invest, the greater the sunk costs are, and the greater the urge to continue becomes.
>-- pp 30, [[The Art of Thinking Clearly Book Summary]]

>[!quote]
>This irrational behavior is driven by *a need for* **consistency**. After all, *consistency signifies credibility.* We find contradictions abominable. If we decide to cancel a project halfway through, we create a contradiction: We admit that we once thought differently. Carrying on with a meaningless project delays this painful realization and keeps up appearances.

>[!quote]
>"We've come this far..." "I've read so much of this book already..." "But I've spent two years doing this course..." If you recognize any of these thought patterns, it shows that the sunk cost fallacy is at work in a corner of your brain.

>[!quote]
>Of course, there may be good reasons to continue investing in something to finalize it. But beware of doing so for the wrong reasons, such as to justify nonrecoverable investments. Rational decision making requires you to *forget about the costs incurred to date*. No matter how much you have already invested, **only your assessment of the future costs and benefits counts.**
