## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Endowment Effect
>
>In [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology") and [behavioral economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics "Behavioral economics"), the **endowment effect** (also known as **divestiture aversion**) is the finding that people are *more likely* to **retain** an object **they own** than **acquire** that same object when *they do **not own** it*.[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] The endowment theory can be defined as "an application of **prospect theory** positing that **loss aversion** associated with **ownership** explains observed **exchange asymmetries**."[^5]



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>In real estate, the endowment effect is palpable. Sellers become emotionally attached to their houses and thus systematically overestimate their value. They balk at the market price, expecting buyers to pay more—which is completely absurd since this excess is little more than sentimental value.
>-- pp 84, [[The Art of Thinking Clearly Book Summary]]

>Amazingly, the endowment effect affects not only possession, but also **near ownership**. **Auction** houses like Christie's and Sotheby's thrive on this. A person who bids until the end of an auction gets *the feeling that the object is practically theirs*, thus *increasing its value*. *The would-be owner is suddenly willing to pay much more than planned*, and any withdrawal from the bidding is perceived as a loss—which defies all logic. In large auctions, such as those for mining rights or mobile radio frequencies, we often observe the winner's curse: Here, the successful bidder turns out to be the economic loser when he gets caught up in the fervor and overbids. I'll offer more insight on the winner's curse in chapter 35.

>In conclusion: **Don't cling to things**. Consider your property something that the "universe" (whatever you believe this to be) has bestowed to you temporarily. Keep in mind that it can recoup this (or more) in the blink of an eye.
