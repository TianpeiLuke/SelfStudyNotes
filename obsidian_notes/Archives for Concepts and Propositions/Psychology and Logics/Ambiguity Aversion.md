>**Name**:  Ambiguity Aversion

>In [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory") and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), **ambiguity aversion** (also known as **uncertainty aversion**) is a **preference for known risks** over unknown risks.
