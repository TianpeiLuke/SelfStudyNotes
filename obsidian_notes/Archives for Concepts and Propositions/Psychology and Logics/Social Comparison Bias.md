## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Social Comparison Bias
>
>**Social comparison bias** is the tendency to have feelings of *dislike and competitiveness* with someone seen as physically, socially, or mentally *better than oneself*. Social comparison bias or **social comparison theory** is the idea that *individuals determine their own worth* based on how they *compare to others*.



## Explanation


>[!quote]
>**The social comparison bias** is also a *cause for concern* with start-up companies. Guy Kawasaki was the “chief evangelist” at Apple for four years. Today he is a venture capitalist and advises entrepreneurs. Kawasaki says: **“A-players hire people even better than themselves. It’s clear, though, that B-players hire C-players so they can feel superior to them, and C-players hire D-players. If you start hiring B-players, expect what Steve [Jobs] called ‘the bozo explosion’ to happen in your organization.”** In other words, start hiring B-players and you end up with Z-players. Recommendation: **Hire people who are better than you; otherwise, you soon preside over a pack of underdogs.** The so-called *Dunning-Kruger effect* applies to such Z-players: *The inept are gifted at overlooking the extent of their incompetence.* They suffer from illusory superiority, which leads them to make even more thinking errors, thus creating a vicious cycle that erodes the talent pool over time.

>In conclusion: *Do you foster individuals more talented than you?* Admittedly, in the short term, the preponderance of stars can *endanger your status*, but **in the long run, you can only profit from their contributions.** Others will overtake you at some stage anyway. Until then, you should get in the up-and-comers’ good books—and learn from them. This is why I wrote the testimonial in the end.
