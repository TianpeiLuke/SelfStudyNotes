## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Illusory Truth Effect
>
>The **illusory truth effect** (also known as the **illusion of truth effect**, **validity effect**, **truth effect**, or the **reiteration effect**) is the tendency to believe [false information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_information "False information") to be correct **after repeated exposure**. [^1] This phenomenon was first identified in a 1977 study at [Villanova University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_University "Villanova University") and [Temple University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University "Temple University").[^2] [^3] When [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth") is assessed, people rely on **whether** the information is in line with their understanding or if **it feels familiar**. The first condition is logical, as people compare new information with what they already know to be true. **Repetition makes statements easier to process** relative to new, unrepeated statements, leading people to believe that the repeated conclusion is more truthful. The illusory truth effect has also been linked to [hindsight bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias "Hindsight bias"), in which the recollection of confidence is skewed after the truth has been received.
