## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Winner's Curse
>
>The **winner's curse** is a phenomenon that may occur in [common value auctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_value_auction "Common value auction"), where all bidders have *the same* (_[ex post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post "Ex post")_) **value** for an item but *receive different private* (_[ex ante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex-ante "Ex-ante")_) **signals** about this value and wherein the winner is the bidder with the *most optimistic evaluation* of the asset and therefore will tend to **overestimate and overpay**. Accordingly, the winner will be "cursed" in one of two ways: either **the winning bid will exceed the value of the auctioned asset** making the winner worse off in absolute terms, or **the value of the asset will be less than the bidder anticipated**, so the bidder may garner a net gain but will be worse off than anticipated.[^1] [^2]  However, an actual overpayment will generally occur only if the winner fails to account for the winner's curse when bidding.
