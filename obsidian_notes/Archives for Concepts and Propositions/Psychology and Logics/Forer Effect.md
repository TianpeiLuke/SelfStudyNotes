## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Forer Effect or **Barnum Effect**
>
>The **Barnum effect**, also called the **Forer effect** or, less commonly, the **Barnum–Forer effect**, is a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give *high accuracy ratings* to *descriptions of their personality* that supposedly are *tailored specifically to them*, yet which are in fact *vague and general* enough to apply to a wide range of people.[^1] This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"), [fortune telling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_telling "Fortune telling"), [aura reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aura_(paranormal) "Aura (paranormal)"), and some types of [personality tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_test "Personality test").[^1]
