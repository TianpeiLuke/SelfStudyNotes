## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Self-Serving Bias
>
>A **self-serving bias** is any cognitive or perceptual process that is distorted by *the need to maintain and enhance* [**self-esteem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem "Self-esteem"), or the tendency to *perceive oneself in an overly favorable manner*.[^1] It is the belief that individuals tend to ascribe success to their own abilities and efforts, but ascribe failure to external factors.[^2] When individuals reject the validity of negative feedback, focus on their strengths and achievements but overlook their faults and failures, or take more credit for their group's work than they give to other members, they are protecting their self-esteem from threat and injury. These cognitive and perceptual tendencies perpetuate illusions and error, but they also serve the self's need for esteem.[^3]
