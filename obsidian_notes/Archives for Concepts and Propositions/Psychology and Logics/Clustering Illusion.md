## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Clustering Illusion
>
>The **clustering illusion** is the tendency to erroneously consider the inevitable "streaks" or "clusters" *arising* in small samples from random distributions to be *non-random*. The illusion is caused by a human tendency to **underpredict the amount** of [**variability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion "Statistical dispersion") likely to appear in a **small sample** of random or [pseudorandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom "Pseudorandom") data. [^1]



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Have you ever seen faces in the clouds or the outlines of animals in rocks? Of course. This is perfectly normal. *The human brain seeks patterns and rules.* In fact, it takes it one step further: *If it finds no familiar patterns, it simply **invents** some.* The more *diffuse* the signal, such as the background noise on the tape, the *easier* it is to find "hidden messages" in it.

>[!quote]
>In conclusion: When it comes to *pattern recognition*, we are *oversensitive*. Regain your skepticism. If you think you have discovered a pattern, first consider it *pure chance*. If it seems too good to be true, find a mathematician and have the data *tested statistically*.
