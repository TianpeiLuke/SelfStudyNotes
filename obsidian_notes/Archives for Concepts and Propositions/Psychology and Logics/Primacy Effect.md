## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Primacy Effect or *Primacy Bias*
>
>In [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology") and [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), the primacy effect (also known as the *primacy bias*) is a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias "Cognitive bias") that results in a subject *recalling primary information* presented better than information presented *later on*. For example, a subject who reads a sufficiently long list of words is more likely to remember words toward the beginning than words in the middle.


>[!info]
> Primacy bias is related to the [serial-position effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect "Serial-position effect").



## Explanation

>If it were not for the primacy effect, people would refrain from decking out their headquarters with luxuriously appointed entrance halls. Your lawyer would feel happy turning up to meet you in worn-out sneakers rather than beautifully polished designer oxfords.

>*The primacy effect triggers practical errors, too.* Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman describes how he used to grade examination papers at the beginning of his professorship. He did it as most teachers do—in order: student 1 followed by student 2 and so on. This meant that *students who answered the first questions flawlessly endeared themselves to him, thus affecting how he graded the remaining parts of their exams.* So, Kahneman switched methods and began to grade the individual questions in batches—all the answers to question one, then the answers to question two, and so forth. Thus, he canceled out the primacy effect.

>Suppose you sit on the board of a company. A point of discussion is raised, a topic on which you have not yet passed judgment. *The first opinion you hear will be crucial to your overall assessment.* The same applies to the other participants, a fact that you can exploit: *If you have an opinion, don’t hesitate airing it first.* This way, you will *influence your colleagues more and draw them over to your side.* If, however, you are *chairing the committee, always ask members’ opinions in random order so that no one has an unfair advantage.*

>When does the primacy effect supersede the recency effect, or vice versa? If you have to **make an immediate decision** based on *a series of “impressions”* (such as characteristics, exam answers, etc.), **the primacy effect weighs heavier**. But if *the series of impressions was formed* **some time ago**, **the recency effect dominates**. For instance, if you listened to a speech a few weeks ago, you will remember the final point or punch line more clearly than your first impressions.

>In conclusion: **First and last impressions dominate**, meaning the content sandwiched between has only a weak influence. Try to avoid evaluations based on first impressions. They will deceive you, guaranteed, in one way or another. *Try to assess all aspects impartially*. It’s not easy, but there are ways around it. For example, in interviews, I jot down a score every five minutes and calculate the average afterward. This way, I make sure that the “middle” counts just as much as hello and good-bye.
