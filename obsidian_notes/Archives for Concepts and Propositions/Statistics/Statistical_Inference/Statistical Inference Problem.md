## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: 

>[!important] 
>The **loss function** plays a crucial role in **statistical decision theory**.
>
> *Loss functions* can be obtained from a **utility analysis** (Berger, 1985), but in many problems they have to be determined *subjectively.* 
> 
> In **statistical inference**, we make an inference *about* the **unknown population** based on the *sample* $X$ and inference procedures without using any loss function, although any inference procedure can be cast in decision-theoretic terms as a decision rule. 
> 
> There are **three main types** of inference procedures: 
> - **point estimators**, 
> - **hypothesis tests**, and 
> - **confidence sets**.

>The problem of **statistical inference** on $f$, broadly speaking, can be divided into **three intimately connected problems** of using the *observation* $Y$ to 
>- **Estimate** the *parameter* $f$ by an estimator $T(Y)$,
>- **Test hypotheses** on $f$ based on test functions $\Psi(Y)$ *and/or* 
>- **Construct confidence sets** $C(Y)$ that *contain* $f$ with *high probability*.
