## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: *Population* and *Sample* and *Statistical Problem*


>[!important] Definition
>Let $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mathcal{P})$ be *probability space*. 
>
>In *statistical decision theory* and *statistical inference*, the *data set* is viewed as a realization or observation of a *random element* on $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mathcal{P})$ related to the *random experiment*.
>
>- The probability measure $\mathcal{P}$ is called the **population.**
>- The *data set* or the *random element* that produces the data is called a **sample** from $\mathcal{P}$.
>- The *size* of the data set is called the **sample size**.
>- A *population* $\mathcal{P}$ is **known** if and only if $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is a *known value* for every event $A \in \mathscr{F}$.
>
>In a **statistical problem**, the population $\mathcal{P}$ is at least **partially unknown** and we would like to deduce some *properties* of $\mathcal{P}$ based on the *available sample*.
