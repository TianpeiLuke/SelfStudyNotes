## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Statistics

>[!important] Definition
>A *measurable function* of $X$, $$T(X),$$ is called a **statistic** if $T(X)$ is a *known value* whenever $X$ is *known*, i.e., the function $T$ is a *known function*.

- [[Measurable Function]]
- [[Random Element and Random Variable]]


## Explanation

>[!info]
>From a *probabilistic point of view*, the **“information”** *within the statistic* $T(X)$ concerning the **unknown distribution** of $X$ is contained in the **$\sigma$-field** $\sigma(T (X)).$

- [[sigma Algebra]]
- [[Probability Space]]

>[!info]
>Note that $$\sigma(T (X)) \subset \sigma(X)$$ and the *two $\sigma$-fields* are the *same* if and only if $T$ is *one-to-one*. 
>
>Usually $\sigma(T (X))$ **simplifies** $\sigma(X)$, i.e., **a statistic provides a “reduction” of the $\sigma$-field**.
