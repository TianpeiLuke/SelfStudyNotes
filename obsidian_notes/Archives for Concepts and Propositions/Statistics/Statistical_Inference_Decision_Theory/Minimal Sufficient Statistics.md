## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Minimal Sufficient Statistics

>[!important] Definition
>Let $T$ be a *sufficient statistic* for $\mathcal{P} \in \mathscr{P}$. 
>
>$T$ is called a **minimal sufficient statistic** if and only if, for any *other statistic* $S$ *sufficient* for $\mathcal{P} \in \mathscr{P}$, there is a *measurable function* $\psi$ such that $$T = \psi(S)\quad \mathcal{P}\text{-a.s.}.$$
