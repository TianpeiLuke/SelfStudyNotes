## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Point Estimator

![[Statistical Estimation Problem#^994e95]]


>[!quote] 
>The problem of estimating an unknown parameter related to the unknown population is introduced in ... and the discussion .. as a special *statistical decision problem*.
>
>In **statistical inference**, however, *estimators of parameters* are derived based on **some principle** (such as the *unbiasedness*, *invariance*, *sufficiency*, *substitution principle*, *likelihood principle*, *Bayesian principle*, etc.), **not based on a loss or risk function**. 
>
>Since *confidence sets* are sometimes also called **interval estimators** or **set estimators**, *estimators of parameters* are called **point estimators.**

>[!important] Definition
>Let $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mathcal{P})$ be probability space. The probability measure $\mathcal{P}$ is indexed by some parameter $\theta$.  
>
>Let $X_{1} \,{,}\ldots{,}\, X_{n}$ be $n$ independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables from distribution $F$. 
>
>A **point estimator** $\hat{\theta}$ **of a parameter** $\theta$ is some function $g$ of $X_{1} \,{,}\ldots{,}\, X_{n}$:
>$$
>\hat{\theta}_{n} := g\left( X_{1} \,{,}\ldots{,}\, X_{n} \right)
>$$
