## Concept Definition

>[!important] Optimal Tranport Problem
>The problem of **optimal transport** concerns about **moving simultaneously several items** (or a continuous distribution thereof) *from one configuration onto another* **with the least amount of cost or effort.**
>

>[!info]
>All major economic problems, in logistics, production planning or network
routing, involve moving distributions, and that thread appears in all of the seminal references on optimal transport.
