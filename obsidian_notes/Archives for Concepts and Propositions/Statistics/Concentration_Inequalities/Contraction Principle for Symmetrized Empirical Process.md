## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Contraction Principle for Symmetrized Empirical Process


>[!important] Contraction Principle
>Let $x_1 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, x_n$ be **sequences** whose real-valued components are indexed by $T,$ that is, $$x_i = (x_{i,s})_{s \in T}.$$ 
>
>Let $\alpha_i \in [0, 1]$ for $i = 1 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, n$. Let $\epsilon_1  \,{,}\ldots{,}\,\epsilon_n$ be **independent Rademacher random variables**. 
>
>Then
>$$
> \begin{align}
> \mathbb{E}\left[ \sup_{s\in T}\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \,\alpha_i\, x_{i,s} \right]  \le \mathbb{E}\left[  \sup_{s\in T}\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i\,  x_{i,s} \right]
> \end{align}
>$$
