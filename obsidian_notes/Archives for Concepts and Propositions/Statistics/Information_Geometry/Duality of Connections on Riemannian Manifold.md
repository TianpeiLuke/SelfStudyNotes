## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Duality of Connections on Riemannian Manifold

![[Levi Civita Connection and Riemannian Connection#^838914]]

>[!important] Definition
>Let $(M, g)$ be a *Riemannian* or *pseudo-Riemannian manifold* (with or without boundary). 
>
>Two *affine connections* $\nabla, \nabla^{*}$ on $TM$ $$\nabla, \nabla^{*}: \mathfrak{X}(M) \times \mathfrak{X}(M) \to \mathfrak{X}(M)$$ are  **dual connections** two each other with respect to $g$, if for any $X, Y, Z\in \mathfrak{X}(M)$, $$Z\left\langle  X\,,\, Y   \right\rangle_{g} = \left\langle \nabla_{Z}X\,,\, Y \right\rangle_{g} + \left\langle  X\,,\,  \nabla_{Z}^{*}Y \right\rangle_{g}$$
>- We call $\nabla^{*}$ the **dual connection** or **conjugate connection** of $\nabla$.
>- The *triple* $$(g, \nabla, \nabla^{*})$$ is called a **dualistic structure** on $\mathcal{M}$.
