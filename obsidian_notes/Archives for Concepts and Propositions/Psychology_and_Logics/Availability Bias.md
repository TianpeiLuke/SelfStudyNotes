## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Availability Bias
>
>The **availability heuristic**, also known as **availability bias**, is a *mental shortcut* that relies on **immediate** *examples* that **come to** a given person's **mind** when *evaluating* a specific topic, concept, method, or decision. This [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristics_in_judgment_and_decision_making "Heuristics in judgment and decision making"), operating on the notion that, *if something can be [recalled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory) "Recall (memory)"), it must be important*, or at least *more important* than alternative solutions *not as readily recalled*,[^1] is inherently **biased toward recently acquired information**.[^2] [^3]


## Explanation

>[!quote]
>The *availability bias* says this: We create a picture of the world using **the examples that most easily come to mind**. This is idiotic, of course, because in reality, things don't happen more frequently just because we can *conceive of them more easily*.
>
>Thanks to the availability bias, we travel through life with *an incorrect risk map in our heads*. Thus, we **systematically overestimate** the risk of being the victims of a plane crash, a car accident, or a murder. And we **underestimate the risk** of dying from less spectacular means, such as diabetes or stomach cancer. The chances of bomb attacks are much rarer than we think, and the chances of suffering depression are much higher. We attach too much likelihood to spectacular, flashy, or loud outcomes. Anything silent or invisible we downgrade in our minds. Our brains *imagine showstopping outcomes more readily* than *mundane ones*. **We think dramatically, not quantitatively**.

>If something is **repeated often enough**, it gets *stored at the forefront of our minds*. It doesn't even have to be true.

>The availability bias has an established seat at the corporate board's table, too. Board members discuss what management has submitted.... They *tend not to discuss what's not on the agenda*. In addition, people **prefer information that is easy to obtain**, be it economic data or recipes. They make decisions based on this information rather than on *more relevant but harder-to-obtain information*—often with disastrous results. For example, we have known for ten years that the so-called Black-Scholes formula for the pricing of derivative financial products does not work. But we don't have another solution, so we carry on with an incorrect tool. It is as if you were in a foreign city without a map, and then pulled out one for your hometown and simply used that. *We prefer wrong information to no information*. Thus, the availability bias has presented the banks with billions in losses.

>Fend it off by spending time with *people who think differently* than you do—people whose experiences and expertise are different from yours. We require others' input to overcome the availability bias.

## Usage of Availability Bias

- Keep *important information* in place that is *more accessible* and is *more ready to use*.
- Associate things to memorize with things that *easily come to mind*.
- *Value different perspectives*
