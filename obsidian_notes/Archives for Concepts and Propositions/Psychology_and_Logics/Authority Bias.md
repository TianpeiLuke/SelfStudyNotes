>**Name**:  Authority Bias
>
>**Authority bias** is the tendency to *attribute greater accuracy* to the opinion of an [**authority**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_(sociology) "Authority (sociology)") figure (unrelated to its content) and be more [influenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_influence "Social influence") by that opinion.[^1] An individual is more [influenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_influence "Social influence") by the opinion of this authority figure, believing their views to be more credible, and hence place greater emphasis on the authority figure's viewpoint and are more likely to [obey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obedience_(human_behavior) "Obedience (human behavior)") them. This concept is considered one of the [**social cognitive biases**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Social "List of cognitive biases") or **collective cognitive biases**.
