## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Survivorship Bias
>
>**Survivorship bias** or **survival bias** is the [logical error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_error "Logical error") of *concentrating* on entities that *passed a selection process* while *overlooking* those that *did not*. This can lead to incorrect conclusions because of *incomplete data*.

## Explanation


>[!info]
>**Survivorship bias** is a form of [**selection bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias "Selection bias") that can lead to *overly optimistic beliefs* because multiple failures are *overlooked*, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the *false belief* that the **successes** in a group have some **special property**, rather than just **coincidence** as in [correlation "proves" causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc "Post hoc ergo propter hoc").

>[!info]
>Another kind of survivorship bias would involve thinking that an incident happened *in a particular way* because the *only people* who were involved in the incident who can speak about it are those who *survived it*. Even if one knew that some people are dead, they would not have their voice to add to the conversation, making it biased.

>Survivorship bias is one of the research issues brought up in the provocative 2005 paper "[Why Most Published Research Findings Are False](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Most_Published_Research_Findings_Are_False "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False")", which shows that a large number of published medical research papers contain results that cannot be replicated.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#cite_note-ioannidis2005-3)

>Behind every popular author, you can find a hundred other writers whose books will never sell. Behind them are another hundred who haven't found publishers. Behind them are yet another hundred whose unfinished manuscripts gather dust in drawers. And behind each one of these are a hundred people who dream of—one day—writing a book. You, however, hear of only the successful authors (these days, many of them self-published) and fail to recognize *how unlikely literary success is*.

>Survivorship bias means this: People *systematically overestimate their chances of success*. Guard against it by frequently visiting *the graves of once-promising projects, investments, and careers*. It is a sad walk but one that should clear your mind.
