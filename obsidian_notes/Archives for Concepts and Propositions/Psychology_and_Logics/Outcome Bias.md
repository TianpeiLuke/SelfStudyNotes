## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Outcome Bias
>
>The **outcome bias** is an error made in *evaluating the quality* of a decision when *the outcome* of that [decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making "Decision-making") is already *known*. Specifically, the outcome effect occurs when the same "behavior produce[s] more ethical condemnation when it happen[s] to produce bad rather than good outcome, even if the *outcome is determined by chance*."[^1]

>[!info]
>While similar to the [hindsight bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias "Hindsight bias"), the two phenomena are markedly different. Hindsight bias focuses on *memory distortion* to *favor the actor*, while the outcome bias focuses *exclusively on weighting the outcome heavier* than other pieces of information in deciding if a past decision was correct.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>The monkey story illustrates *the outcome bias*: We tend to evaluate decisions based on the result rather than on the decision process. This fallacy is also known as the **"historian error."** A classic example is the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Should the military base have been evacuated or not? From today's perspective: obviously, for there was plenty of evidence that an attack was imminent. However, only in retrospect do the signals appear so clear. At the time, in 1941, there was a plethora of contradictory signals. Some pointed to an attack; others did not. *To assess the quality of the decision, we must use the information available at the time*, filtering out everything we know about it post-attack (particularly that it did indeed take place).
