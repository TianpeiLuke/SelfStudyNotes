## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Social Proof
>
>**Social proof** (or **informational social influence**) is a [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology") and [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social "Social") phenomenon wherein people *copy the actions of others* in choosing how to behave in a given situation.

>[!info]
>Social proof is used in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate _mode of behavior_, and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation.

>[!info]
>Social proof is one type of [conformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity_(psychology) "Conformity (psychology)"). When a person is in a situation where they are unsure of the correct way to behave, they will often look to others for clues concerning the correct behavior. When "we conform because we believe that others' interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and will help us choose an appropriate course of action",[^1] it is informational social influence. This is contrasted with [normative social influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_social_influence "Normative social influence") wherein a person conforms to be liked or accepted by others.

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>**Social proof**, sometimes roughly termed the **"herd instinct,"** dictates that *individuals* feel they are *behaving correctly* *when they act the same as other people*. In other words, the *more* people who *follow* a certain idea, the *better* (truer) we deem the idea to be. And the more people who display a certain behavior, the more appropriate this behavior is judged by others. This is, of course, absurd.

>Social proof is the evil behind bubbles and *stock market panic*. It exists in fashion, management techniques, hobbies, religion, and diets. It can paralyze whole cultures, such as when sects commit collective suicide.
