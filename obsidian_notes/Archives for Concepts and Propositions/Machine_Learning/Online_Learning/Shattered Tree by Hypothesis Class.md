## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Shattered Tree by Hypothesis Class



## Explanation

>[!important]
>Compared to the [[Shattering of Set by Set Family]], the **(partial) ordering** $\prec$ of the *samples* $(x_{1} \,{,}\ldots{,}\,x_{T})$ plays an important role in *measuring* the shattering capability of a hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$
