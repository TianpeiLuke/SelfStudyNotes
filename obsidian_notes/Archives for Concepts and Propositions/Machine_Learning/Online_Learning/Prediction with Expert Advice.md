## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Prediction with Expert Advice

>[!important] Definition
>Given an *non-stochastic* sequence $y_{1}\,, y_{2} \,{,}\ldots{,}\,$ in $\mathcal{Y}$, the task of **online prediction** is to generate predictions $\hat{y}_{1},\,\hat{y}_{1} \,{,}\ldots{,}\,$ in $\mathcal{D}$ so that the **cumulative loss** or **regret** is **minimized**. 
>- $\mathcal{Y}$ is called the **outcome space**. The outcome is generated by the **environment**.
>- $\mathcal{D}$ is called the **decision space**.
>	- It is common to assume that $\mathcal{D}$ is a **compact** and **convex** space.
>- The **loss function** $\ell$ is defined as $$\ell: \mathcal{D} \times \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}_{+}$$ For each prediction $\hat{y}_{t}$ and outcome $y_{t}$, the value of loss is called the **score** $\ell(\hat{y}_{t}, y_{t})$.

>[!important] Definition
>In the task of **online prediction with expert advices**, there are several additional settings
>- **Experts**: a set $\mathcal{E}$ of **reference forecaster**. 
>	- For each time $t$, experts generate a set of predictions $$\left\{ f_{E}^{(t)}: E \in \mathcal{E} \right\} \subset \mathcal{D}$$
>- **Forecaster** computes its own guess $\hat{y}_{t}$ based on expert advices $\left\{ f_{E}^{(t)}: E \in \mathcal{E} \right\}$  for the outcome $y_{t}$

### Prediction with Expert Advice

>[!important] Definition
>The **online prediction with expert advice** is described  in high-level as follows:
>- *Input*: a set of experts in $\mathcal{E}$
>- *Input*: *decision space* $\mathcal{D}$ and *outcome space* $\mathcal{Y}$
>- *Input*: a loss function $$\ell: \mathcal{D} \times \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}_{+}$$
>- For $t = 1\,{,}\ldots{,}\,T$:
>	- **Expert** $E\in \mathcal{E}$  **predicts** $f_{E}^{(t)}\in \mathcal{D}$ 
>	- **Forecaster** chooses prediction $\hat{y}_{t} \in \mathcal{D}$ based on $\left\{ f_{E}^{(t)}: E \in \mathcal{E} \right\}$
>	- *Environment* reveals **outcome** $y_{t}\in \mathcal{Y}$
>	- *Forecaster* incurs **loss** $$\ell(\hat{y}_{t}, y_{t})$$
>	- Each Expert incurs *loss* $$\ell(f_{E}^{(t)}, y_{t}), \; E\in \mathcal{E}$$
