## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Multi-Modal Learning

>[!important] Definition
>**Multi-Modal Learning** is a machine learning paradigm where models are designed to process and *integrate information from multiple modalities*—such as text, images, audio, video, or structured data—to perform a task more effectively than using any single modality alone.


## Explanation

>[!info]
>By jointly learning from heterogeneous data sources, multi-modal models can capture richer and complementary representations of the underlying concepts, enabling *improved performance* in tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, speech recognition, and multi-modal retrieval.

>[!info]
>Successful multi-modal learning requires addressing challenges such as 
>- **modality alignment**, 
>- **missing modality handling**, 
>- and **cross-modal interactions** to fully leverage the shared and unique information contained in each modality.
