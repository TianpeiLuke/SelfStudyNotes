## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Reinforcement Learning

>[!important] Definition
>Compared to *supervised learning* where the training samples are used to **instruct** by giving the correct actions, in **reinforcement learning**, training samples are used to **evaluate** the actions taken. 
>
>Purely **evaluative feedback** indicates how good the actions taken was, but not whether or not it was the best or worst action possible, and purely **instructive feedback**, on the other hand, indicates the *correct action* to take, independently of the action *actually taken*. 
>
>
>In their pure forms, these two kinds of feedback are quite distinct: 
>- **evaluative feedback** depends entirely on the action *taken*, 
>- whereas **instructive feedback** is *independent* of the action taken. 
>  
>In other words, 
>- *supervised learning* **enforce** each step to be as **instructed** 
>- whereas the *reinforcement learning* only cares if the **end goal** is *reached*, and does not care the process.
