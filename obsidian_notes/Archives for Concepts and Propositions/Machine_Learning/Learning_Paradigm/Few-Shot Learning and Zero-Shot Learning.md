## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Few-Shot Learning and Zero-Shot Learning

>[!important] Definition
>**Few-shot learning** is referred to a supervised learning task where there are *very few labelled examples* of the new classes.
>- When only a *single labelled example* is used it is called **one-shot learning**.
>- When the learned model can directly adapt to the new task without new labeled sample, it is called the **zero-shot learning.**

>[!important] Definition
>**N-way K-shot Learning** is a common experimental setup in few-shot learning and meta-learning, particularly for classification. 
>- Each task involves distinguishing between *$N$ classes*, with *$K$ labeled* examples (shots) provided for each class in the support set.
