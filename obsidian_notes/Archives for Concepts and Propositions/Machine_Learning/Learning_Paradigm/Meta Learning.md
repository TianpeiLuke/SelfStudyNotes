## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Meta Learning

>[!important] Definition
>The goal of **meta-learning** is to “*learn the learning algorithm*” or **learning to learn**.
>- A common way to do this is to provide the **meta-learner** with a set of datasets from *different distributions*.
>- Whereas *multitask learning* aims to make predictions for a *fixed* set of tasks, the aim of **meta-learning** is to make predictions for *future tasks* that were *not seen* during training.
