## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Foundational Models for Transfer Learning

>[!important] Definition
>**Foundational Models** are large, versatile machine learning models trained on *broad, diverse datasets* at scale, designed to be *adapted* to a *wide range* of *downstream tasks* with minimal task-specific supervision. 
>- By leveraging massive *pretraining*—often using *self-supervised* or *weakly supervised objectives*—foundational models such as GPT, BERT, CLIP, and DALL-E develop rich *internal representations* that can generalize across domains, modalities, and tasks. 

### Strength

>[!important]
>The **strength** of *foundational models* lies in the ability to *transfer knowledge* to new applications through **fine-tuning**, **prompting**, or **adaptation**, enabling rapid development of powerful AI systems without retraining from scratch.

### Challenges

>[!important]
>However, foundational models also raise **challenges** related to **bias**, **robustness**, **interpretability**, and **societal impact**, given their size, opacity, and broad influence across different use cases.
