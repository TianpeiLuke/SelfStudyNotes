## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Expected Sarsa Algorithm

>[!info]
>One of the early breakthroughs in reinforcement learning was the development of an off-policy TD control algorithm known as **Q-learning**.
>
>Instead of Bellman equation for $q$, we now consider the *Bellman optimality equation* for $q_{*}$
