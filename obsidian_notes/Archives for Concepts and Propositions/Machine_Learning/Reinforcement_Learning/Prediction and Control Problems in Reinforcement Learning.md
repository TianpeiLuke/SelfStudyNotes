## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Prediction and Control Problems in Reinforcement Learning

>[!important] Definition
>In reinforcement learning, there are two major distinct tasks: 
>- **Policy evaluation** or **Prediction** is the task of *determining the value function* for a specific policy. 
>	- Note that the value function is a **prediction of future rewards**, in terms of *expected returns*. 
>	- Thus **estimation** of *value function* is a task of predicting future rewards. 
>	- The prediction task is an **unsupervised learning task**, since no human label is required and we just need to wait for the rewards. 
> - **Policy Improvement** or **Control**  is the task of **finding a policy** to obtain as much reward as possible. 
> 	- In other words, finding a policy which *maximizes the value function*.
