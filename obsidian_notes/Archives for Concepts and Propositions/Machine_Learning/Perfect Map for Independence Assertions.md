## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Perfect Map for Independence Assertions

>[!important] Definition
>We say a *graph* $\mathcal{K}$ is a **perfect map** (**P-map**) *for a set of independencies* $\mathcal{I}$ if we have that $$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{K}) = \mathcal{I}.$$
>
>We say that $\mathcal{K}$ is a **perfect map** (**P-map**) *for* $\mathcal{P}$ if $$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{K}) = \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{P}).$$

>[!info]
>That is, the graph $\mathcal{K}$ **precisely captures the independencies** in a given distribution $\mathcal{P}$.
