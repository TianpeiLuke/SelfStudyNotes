## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Derivative-Free Optimization

>[!important] Definition
>**Derivative-free optimization** or **DFO** refers to a class of techniques for optimizing functions *without using derivatives*. 
>
>This is useful for **blackbox function optimization** as well as **discrete optimization**.

- [[Integer Programming Problem]]

>[!important] Definition
>A class of DFO is called the **black-box optimization** where the algorithm can *only access* $f$ via its output $f(x)$.
