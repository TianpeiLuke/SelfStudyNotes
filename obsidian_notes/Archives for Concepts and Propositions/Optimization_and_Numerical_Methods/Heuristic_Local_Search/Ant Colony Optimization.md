## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: 



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>**Ant colony optimization** is a *stochastic method* for **optimizing paths through graphs**. This method was inspired by some ant species that wander randomly in search of food, leaving **pheromone trails** as they go. Other ants that stumble upon a *pheromone trail* are likely to start following it, thereby reinforcing the trail’s scent. Pheromones *slowly evaporate over time*, causing *unused trails to fade*. Short paths, with stronger pheromones, are traveled more often and thus attract more ants. Thus, short paths create positive feedback that lead other ants to follow and further reinforce the shorter path.
