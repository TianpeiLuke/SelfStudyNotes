>[!important] Definition
>Consider a **combinatorial optimization problem**
>$$
>\begin{align*}
> \max_{x} &\; f(x)\\
> \text{ s.t. }&\; x \in \mathcal{X}
>\end{align*} 
>$$
>where $\mathcal{X}$ is a *(finite) discrete set* and $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a real-value function. 
>
>The **hill climbing** or **steapest ascent** or **greedy search** algorithm finds the *optimal solution* as follow:
>- Initialize $x_{0}$
>- Initialize $f_{max} = -\infty$, $x^{*}= x_{0}$
>- For $t=0,\,1\,{,}\ldots{,}\,$ until the *termination condition* is satisfied:
>	- $$x_{t+1} = \arg\max_{x \in \mathcal{N}(x_{t})}f(x)$$ where $\mathcal{N}(x)$ is the *neighborhood* of $x$ in (*discrete topology* of) $\mathcal{X}$.
>	- If $f(x_{t+1}) > f_{max}$:
>		- $x^{*} = x_{t+1}$
>		- $f_{max} = f(x_{t+1})$
>	- else:
>		- Return $x^{*}$ as **local maximal solution** and $f_{max}$ as **local maximum**.
