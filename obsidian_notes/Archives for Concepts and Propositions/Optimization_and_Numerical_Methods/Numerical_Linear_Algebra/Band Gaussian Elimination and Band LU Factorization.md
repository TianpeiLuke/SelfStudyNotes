## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Band Gaussian Elimination and Band LU Factorization

![[LU Factorization of Matrix#^62518f]]

![[Gaussian Elimination for Solving Linear System#^057350]]

>[!important] Theorem
>Suppose $A\in M_{n}$ has a **LU factorization** $$A = LU.$$
>
>If $A$ has **upper bandwidth** $q$ and **lower bandwith** $p$, then $U$ has **upper bandwidth** $q$ and $L$ has **lower bandwith** $p$.
