## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Gaussian Elimination for Solving Linear System





- [[Elementary Row and Column Operations]]

## Explanation

>[!quote]
>Triangular system solving is an easy $O(n^2)$ computation. The **idea** behind **Gaussian  elimination** is to *convert* a given system $Ax = b$ to an equivalent **triangular system**. The conversion is achieved by taking appropriate linear combinations of the equations.
