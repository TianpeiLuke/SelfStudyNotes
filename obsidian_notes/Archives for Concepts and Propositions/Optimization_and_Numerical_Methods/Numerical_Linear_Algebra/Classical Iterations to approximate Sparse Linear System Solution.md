## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Classical Iterations to approximate Linear System Solution

>[!important] Definition
>The **classical iteration** methods for $$Ax = b$$ problem generate a *sequence of approximate solutoins* $\{ x^{(k)} \}$ that converges to $$x = A^{-1}b.$$
>- Typically, the matrix $A$ is involved only in the context of **matrix-vector multiplication** and that is what makes this framework  attractive when $A$ is **large** and **sparse**.
