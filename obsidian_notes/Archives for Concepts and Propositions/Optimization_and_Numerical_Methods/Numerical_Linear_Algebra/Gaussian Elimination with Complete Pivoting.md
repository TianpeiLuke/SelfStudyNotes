## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Gaussian Elimination with Complete Pivoting

![[Gaussian Elimination for General Linear System#^5aee93]]

- [[Gaussian Elimination for General Linear System]]

### Partial Pivoting

### Outer Product LU with Complete Pivoting





## Explanation

>[!quote]
>The analysis in the previous section shows that we must take steps to ensure that **no large entries** *appear* in the computed triangular factors $\hat{L}$ and $\hat{U}$.
