## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Linear Multistep Methods for Numerical ODE



## Explanation

>[!quote]
>The families of **linear multistep methods (LMMs)** that we turn to next generally achieve higher order by *exploiting the “history”* that is available -- values of $x$ and $x_{0}$ that were computed at the previous $k$ steps are *combined* to generate an *approximation* at the next step. This information is assimilated via what are effectively **multipoint Taylor expansions**.
