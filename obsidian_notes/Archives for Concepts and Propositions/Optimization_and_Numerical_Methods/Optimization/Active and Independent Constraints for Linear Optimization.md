## Concept Definition

>**Name**: Active and Independent Constraints for Linear Optimization

### Active Constraint for LP

>[!important] Definition
>If a vector $x^{*}$ satisfies the *equality condition* for the corresponding *inequality or inequality constraint*, then we say that the corresponding constraint is **active** or **binding** at $x^{*}$.

^90a3c5


>[!important] Proposition
>Let $x^{*}$ be an element in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and let $$I = \left\{ i: \left\langle  a_{i}\,,\, x^{*}   \right\rangle = b_{i} \right\} $$ be the set of *indices* of *constraints* that are **active** at $x^{*}$. Then, the following are **equivalent**:
>- There exists $n$ vectors in the set $$\left\{ a_{i}: i\in I \right\},$$ which are **linearly independent**.
>- The **span** of the vectors $\left\{ a_{i}: i\in I \right\}$, is **all** of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, that is, every element of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be expressed as a **linear combination** of the vectors $a_{i}, i\in I$.
>- The system of *equations* $$\left\langle  a_{i}\,,\, x^{*}   \right\rangle = b_{i}, \;\; i\in I$$ has a **unique solution**.

>[!important] Definition
>With a slight abuse of language, we will often say that certain **conÂ­straints** are **linearly independent**, meaning that the corresponding vectors $a_{i}$ are *linearly independent*.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>Note that if the number $m$ of **constraints** used to define a polyhedron $P \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is *less than* $n$, $$m\le n$$ the **number of active constraints** at any given point must also be *less than* $n$, and there are **no basic** or **basic feasible solutions**.
