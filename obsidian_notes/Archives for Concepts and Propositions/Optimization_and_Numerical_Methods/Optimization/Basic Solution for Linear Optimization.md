## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Basic Solution for Linear Optimization

### Basic Solution for LP

>[!important] Definition
>Consider a *polyhedron* $P$ defined by linear equality and inequality constraints, and let $x^{*}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$.
>
>A vector $x^{*}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is said to be a **basic solution** of LP if

>[!important] Definition
>If $x^{*}$ is a *basic solution* that satisfies *all of the constraints*, we say that it is a **basic feasible solutions**.

>[!important] Theorem
>Let $P$ be a nonempty polyhedron and let $x^{*} \subset P$. Then, the following are **equivalent**:
>- $x^{*}$ is a **vertex**;
>- $x^{*}$ is an **extreme point**;
>- $x^{*}$ is a **basic feasible solution**.

>[!important] Corollary
>Given a **finite** number of **linear inequality constraints**, there can only be a **finite** number of **basic or basic feasible solutions**.

### Adjacent Basic Solution

>[!important] Definition
>Two distinct basic solutions to a set of *linear constraints* in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are said to be **adjacent** if we can find $n - 1$ *linearly independent constraints* that are *active* at both of them.



## Explanation

>[!info]
>Note that if the number $m$ of **constraints** used to define a polyhedron $P \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is *less than* $n$, $$m\le n$$ the **number of active constraints** at any given point must also be *less than* $n$, and there are **no basic** or **basic feasible solutions**.


## Polyhedral in standard form

>[!important]
>Let $$P = \left\{ x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}:\; Ax = b,\; x \succeq 0 \right\} $$ be a polyhedron in **standard form**, and let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times e n}$, where $m$ is the number of **equality constraints**.

>[!important] Theorem
>Consider the constraints $Ax = b$, and $x \succeq 0$ and assume that the $m \times n$ matrix $A$ has **linearly independent rows**. 
>
>A vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a **basic solution** *if and only if* we have $Ax = b$, and there exist **indices** $$B(1) \,{,}\ldots{,}\, B(m)$$ such that:
>- The columns $$A_{B(1)} \,{,}\ldots{,}\,A_{B(m)}$$ are **linearly independent**;
>- If $i \neq B(1) \,{,}\ldots{,}\, B(m)$, then $$x_{i} = 0$$

## Procedure for Constructing Basic Solution

>[!important] Procedure for constructing basic solutions
>1. Choose $m$ **linearly independent columns** $$A_{B(1)} \,{,}\ldots{,}\,A_{B(m)}Â·$$ 
>2. Let $x_{i} = 0$ for all $i \neq B(1) \,{,}\ldots{,}\, B(m)$. 
>3. Solve the **system of $m$ equations** $$Ax = b$$ for the unknowns $$x_{B(1)} \,{,}\ldots{,}\,x_{B(m)}$$
