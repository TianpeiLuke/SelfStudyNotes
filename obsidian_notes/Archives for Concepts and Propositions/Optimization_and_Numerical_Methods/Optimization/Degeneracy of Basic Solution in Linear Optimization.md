## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Degeneracy of Basic Solution in Linear Optimization

>[!important] Definition
>Consider the *standard form polyhedron* $$P = \left\{ x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}:\; Ax = b, \; x \succeq 0 \right\}$$  and let $x$ be a *basic solution*. 
>
>Let $m$ be the number of *rows* of $A$. The vector $x$ is a **degenerate basic solution** if *more than* $n - m$ of the *components* of $x$ are *zero*.
