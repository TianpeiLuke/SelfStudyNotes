>[!quote]
>Two important **algorithm design paradigms** are based on breaking problems down into smaller problems. 
>- In Chapter 10, we will see **dynamic programming**, which typically *removes* one element from the problem, solves the smaller problem, and then *adds back* the element to the solution of this smaller problem in the proper way. 
>- **Divide and conquer** instead *splits* the problem into (say) halves, solves *each* half, then *stitches* the pieces back together to form a full solution.
