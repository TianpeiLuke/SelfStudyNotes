## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Algorithm Best-Case Running Time Analysis

>[!important] Definition
>The **best-case (running-time) complexity** is the *minimum running time* for *any input* of size $n$
>- The best-case running time of an algorithm gives an *lower bound* on the running time for any input.
>- If you know it, then you have a *guarantee* that the algorithm *never takes any longer*.
>- We use *$O$-notation* for worst-case running time.
