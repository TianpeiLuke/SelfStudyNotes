## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Algorithm General Definition

>[!important] Definition
>Informally, an **algorithm** is any well-defined *computational procedure* that 
>- takes some value, or set of values, as **input** 
>- and produces some value, or set of values, as **output** 
>- in a finite amount of time. 
>
>An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

>[!important] Definition
>An **instance of a problem** consists of input (satisfying the *constraints* imposed by the *problem statement*) needed to compute a solution to the problem.

## Explanation

>[!quote] 
>An *algorithm* is a tool to solve a well-specified **computational problem**.
>
>The **statement** of the problem specifies in general terms the *desired input*/*output* relationship for problem instances, typically of arbitrarily large size. 
>- The algorithm describes a specific computational procedure for achieving that input/output relationship for all problem instances.
