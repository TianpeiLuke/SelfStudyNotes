## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Algorithm Average-Case Running Time Analysis

>[!important] Definition
>The **average-case (running time) complexity** is the *expected running time* for *any input* of size $n$.
>- Often, the *average-case* is as bad as the *worst case*.
>- For *randomized algorithm*, the *average-case* is more important.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>It is common to use the *probabilistic technique* to analyze the *average-case complexity.*
