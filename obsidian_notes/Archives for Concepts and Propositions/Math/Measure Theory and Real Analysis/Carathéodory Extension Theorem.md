## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Carathéodory Extension Theorem


>[!important] Carathéodory Extension Theorem
> Let $\mu^{*}: 2^X \rightarrow [0, +\infty]$ be an **outer measure** on a **set** X. 
> 
> Let $\mathscr{B}$ be the collection of *all subsets* of $X$ that are **Carathéodory measurable with respect to $\mu^{*}$**, and let $\mu: \mathscr{B} \rightarrow [0, +\infty]$ be the **restriction** of $\mu^{*}$ to $\mathscr{B}$ so that  $$\mu(E) := \mu^{*}(E)$$
>whenever $E \in \mathscr{B}$. 
>
>Then $\mathscr{B}$ is a **$\sigma$-algebra**, and  $\mu$ is a **measure**.
