## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Mutually Singular, or one measure is singular with respect to another measure


>[!important] Definition
>Two *signed measures* $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $(X,\mathscr{B})$ are **mutually singular**, or that $\nu$ is **singular** w.r.t. to $\mu$, or vice versa, *if and only if* there exists a **partition** $E,F \in \mathscr{B}$ of $X$ such that 
>- $E\cap F = \emptyset$ and 
>- $E\cup F= X$, 
>- $E$ is *null* for $\mu$ and 
>- $F$ is *null* for $\nu$.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>Informal speaking, **mutual singular** means that **$\mu$ and $\nu$ "live on disjoint sets"**. 
>
>We describe it using *perpendicular sign*:
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \mu \perp \nu
> \end{align*}
