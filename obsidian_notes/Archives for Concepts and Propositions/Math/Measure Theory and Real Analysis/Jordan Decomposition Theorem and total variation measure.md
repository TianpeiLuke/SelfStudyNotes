## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: The Jordan Decomposition Theorem


>[!important] Theorem
>If $\nu$ is a *signed measure* on $(X,\mathscr{B})$, there exists **unique positive measures** $\nu_{+}$ and  $\nu_{-}$ such that 
>$$
>\begin{align*}
> \nu = \nu_{+} - \nu_{-} \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \nu_{+} \perp \nu_{-}.
> \end{align*}

>[!important] Definition
>- The two positive measures $\nu_{+}, \nu_{-}$ are called the **positive** and **negative variations** of $\nu$, and 
>
>- $\nu= \nu_{+} - \nu_{-}$ is called the **Jordan decomposition** of $\nu$.

>[!important]
>Furthermore, define the **total variations** of $\nu$ as the measure $\left\lvert \nu \right\rvert$ such that 
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \left\lvert \nu \right\rvert &=  \nu_{+} + \nu_{-}.
> \end{align*}
