## Concept Definition

>**Name**: Set Shrink Regularly and Bounded Eccentricity

>[!important] Definition
>A collection of sets $\set{U_{\alpha}}$ is said to **shrink regularly** *to* $\overline{x}$ or *has* **bounded eccentricity** **at** $\overline{x}$ if there is a **constant** $c>0$ such that for *each* $U_{\alpha}$ there is a *ball* $B$ with 
>- $\overline{x}$ is in the *ball*, i.e. $$\overline{x}\in B;$$
>- the set $U_{\alpha}$ is *contained in* $B$, i.e. $$U_{\alpha} \subset B;$$
>- and the measure of the set $U_{\alpha}$ is **at least $c$** times *the measure of the ball*, i.e.
>  $$
> \begin{align*}
> \qquad m(U_{\alpha}) \ge c\,m(B).
