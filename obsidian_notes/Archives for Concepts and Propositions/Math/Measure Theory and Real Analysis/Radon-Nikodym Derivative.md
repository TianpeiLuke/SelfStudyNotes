## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Radon-Nikodym Derivative


>[!important] Definition
>If $\nu \ll \mu$, then according to *the Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym theorem*, $$d\nu = f d\mu$$ for some $f$, where $f$ is called the **Radon-Nikodym derivative** of $\nu$ w.r.t. $\mu$ and is denoted as
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> f := \frac{d\nu}{ d\mu} \quad \Rightarrow \quad d\nu =  \frac{d\nu}{ d\mu} d\mu.
> \end{align*}

## Explanation

>[!info]
