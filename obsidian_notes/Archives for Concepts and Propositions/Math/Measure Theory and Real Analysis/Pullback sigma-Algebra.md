## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Pullback $\sigma$-Algebra

>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be a *set* and $(Y, \mathscr{F})$ be a *measurable space*, and $f: X \to Y$ be a function. 
>
>Then the collection**
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> f^{*}(\mathscr{F}) & := \left\{f^{-1}(E): E \in \mathscr{F} \right\} \subset 2^{\mathscr{F}}
> \end{align*}
>$$
>is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$; called the **pullback $\sigma$-algebras.**

## Explanation

>[!important]
>The *pull-back $\sigma$-algebra* is the **smallest $\sigma$-algebra** on $X$ for which the function $f : X \to Y$ is **measurable**.
