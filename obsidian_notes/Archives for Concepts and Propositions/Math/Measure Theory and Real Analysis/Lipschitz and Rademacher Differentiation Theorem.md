## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Rademacher Differentiation Theorem

>[!important] Rademacher Differentiation Theorem
>If $U\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set, every **Lipschitz continuous function** $F: U\to \mathbb{R}^m$, is **locally of bounded variation**, and hence **differentiable** *almost everywhere*. 
>
>Furthermore,  the **derivative** $F'$, when it *exists*, is **bounded** in magnitude by the *Lipschitz constant* of $F$.
