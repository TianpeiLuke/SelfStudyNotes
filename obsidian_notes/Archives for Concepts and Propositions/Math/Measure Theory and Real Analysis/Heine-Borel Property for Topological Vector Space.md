## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Heine-Borel Property

>[!important] Theorem
>Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a *topological vector space*. 
>
>$\mathcal{X}$ is said to have the **Heine-Borel property** if every *closed bounded* subset of $\mathcal{X}$ is *compact*.

## Explanation

>[!important]
>In general, many **complete metric space** such as **Banach space** and **Hilbert space** do not have *Heine-Borel property*. 
>
>In other word, the condition for compactness for subspace is for complex. See [[Compactness in Functional Analysis]].

## Property

>[!important]
>**No** **infinite dimensional** *Banach space* has *Heine-Borel property*.


>[!important]
>Let $(\mathcal{X}, d)$ be a metric space. 
>
>$\mathcal{X}$ has a **Heine–Borel metric** which is *Cauchy locally identical* to $d$ *if and only if* it is **$\sigma$-compact**, **locally compact** and **complete.**

>[!info]
>For a subset $E$ of a metric space $(X, d)$,  the following are **equivalent**:
>- $E$ is **totally bounded** and **complete**.
>- **Bolzano-Weierstrass Property**: *Every sequence* in $E$ has **convergent subsequence.**
>- **Heine-Borel Property **: $E$ is **compact**, i.e. every open cover of $E$ has a finite subcover.
