## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Egorov's Theorem

>[!important] Egorov's Theorem
>Let $f_n : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a *sequence of measurable functions* that **converge pointwise almost everywhere** to another function $f : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, and let $\epsilon > 0$. 
>
>Then there exists a *Lebesgue measurable set* $A$ of measure **at most $\epsilon$**, such that $f_n$ **converges locally uniformly** to $f$ **outside** of $A$.
