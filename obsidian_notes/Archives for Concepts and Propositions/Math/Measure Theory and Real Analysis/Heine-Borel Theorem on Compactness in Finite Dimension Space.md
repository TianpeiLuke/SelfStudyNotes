## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Heine-Borel Theorem

>[!important] Heine-Borel Theorem
>For a subset $S$ of Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, the following are **equivalent**:
>- $S$ is **closed** and **bounded**;
>- $S$ is **compact**. That is, for *every open cover* of $S$, there exists a *finite subcover*.

>[!important]
>The above theorem **fails** for many infinite dimensional space, including many complete metric spaces such as **Hilbert space** and **Banach space**.

>[!important]
>[[Banach-Alaoglu Theorem]] states that for a Banach space $\mathcal{X}$ in **weak$^*$ topology** in $\mathcal{X}^{*}$, this theorem still holds.
