## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Monotone Class

>[!important] Definition
>Define a **monotone class** in $X$ is a collection $\mathscr{B}$ of *subsets* of $X$ with the following two **closure properties**:
>
>- If $$E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \ldots$$ are a **countable increasing** *sequence* of sets in $\mathscr{B}$, then $$\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}E_n \in \mathscr{B}.$$
> 
>- If $$E_1 \supset E_2 \supset \ldots$$ are a **countable decreasing** *sequence* of sets in $\mathscr{B}$, then $$\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}E_n \in \mathscr{B}.$$

## Explanation

>[!info]
>A **$\sigma$-algebra** is a *monotone class* in $X$

## Property

>[!important] Monotone Class Lemma
>Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a **Boolean algebra** on $X$. 
>
>Then $\langle \mathscr{A} \rangle$ is the **smallest monotone class** that contains $\mathscr{A}$.
