## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Absolute Continuity for measures


>[!important] Definition
>Suppose $\nu$ is a *signed measure* on $(X,\mathscr{B})$ and $\mu$ is a *positive measure* on $(X,\mathscr{B})$. 
>
>Then $\nu$ is said to be **absolutely continuous** *w.r.t. $\mu$* and write
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \nu \ll \mu 
> \end{align*}
>$$
>if $\nu(E)=0$ for every $E\in \mathscr{B}$ for which $\mu(E)=0$.

>For _monotone and **absolutely continuous function**_ $F$, the corresponding *Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure* is **absolutely continuous** with respect to *Lebesgue measure*.
>$$\mu_{F} \ll m.$$

>This explain the origin of the term "*absolute continuity*" for measures.
