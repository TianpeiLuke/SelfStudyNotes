## Theorem

>**Name**: The Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym Theorem


>[!important] Theorem
>Let $\nu$ be a *$\sigma$-finite* *signed measure* and $\mu$ be a *$\sigma$-finite positive* measure on $(X,\mathscr{B})$. There exists **unique $\sigma$-finite signed measure** $\lambda, \rho$ on $(X, \mathscr{B})$ such that

>\begin{align*}
> \lambda \perp \mu\,, \quad \text{and} \quad \rho \ll \mu\,, \quad \text{and} \quad  \nu= \lambda+ \rho.
>\end{align*} 
>$$ 
>
>In particular, if $\nu \ll \mu$, then 
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> d\nu &= f\, d\mu, \qquad \text{for some }f.

>[!important] Definition
>-  The decomposition $$\nu= \rho + \lambda,$$ where $$\lambda \perp \mu \; \text{ and }\; \rho\ll \mu,$$ is called the **Lebesgue decomposition** of $\nu$ *with respect to* $\mu$.
