## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Closed Graph Theorem for Operator in Banach Space


>[!important] Closed Graph Theorem (Banach Space)
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be **Banach spaces**  and $T$ a **linear map** of $X$ into $Y$. 
>
>Then $T$ is **bounded** *if and only if* the **graph** of  $Î¤$ is **closed**.

## Explanation

>[!important]
>Consider the following statements: 
>
>1. $x_n$ **converges** to some element $x$;
>2. $T x_n$ **converges** to some element $y$; 
>3. $T x = y$.
> 
> Usually to prove $T$ is **continuous**, one need to show that 
> - **given** statement $1$, the statement $2$ **and** $3$ are true. 
> - That is, we need to **prove convergence** of $T x_n$ and need to show **identification** of $T x$ and the limit of $T x_n$.
> 
> With **close graph theorem**, we just need to show that 
> - **given** statement $1$ **and** $2$, statement $3$ is **true**; 
> - that is, we just need to **prove the identification part**.
