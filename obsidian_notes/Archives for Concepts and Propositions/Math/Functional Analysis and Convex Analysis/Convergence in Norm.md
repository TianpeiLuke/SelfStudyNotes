## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Strong Convergence in Banach Space or *Convergence in Norm*


>[!important] Definition
>A sequence $(x_n)$ in a normed space $X$ is said to be **strongly convergent** (or *convergent* **in the norm**) if there is  an $x \in X$ such that
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty} \lVert x_n - x \rVert  = 0.
> \end{align*}
>$$
>This is written $\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty}x_n = x$ or simply $x_n \rightarrow x$. 


>[!important]
>The element $x$ is called **strong limit** of $(x_n)$, and we say that $(x_n)$ *converges* **strongly** to $x$}.

## Explanation


>[!important]
>In **finite dimensional normed spaces**, the distinction between **strong** and **weak** *convergence* disappears completely.
