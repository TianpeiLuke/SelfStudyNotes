## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Subdifferential of Smooth Convex Function


- [[Subdifferential of Convex Function]]

>[!important] Theorem
>Let $f$ be a **convex** function, and let $x$ be a point where $f$ is *finite.*
>
>If $f$ is **differentiable** at $x$, then $\nabla f(x)$ is the **unique** *subgradient* of $f$ at $x$, so that in particular,
>$$
>f(z) \ge f(x) + \left\langle  \nabla f(x)\,,\, z- x    \right\rangle, \quad \forall z.
>$$
>
>*Conversely*, if $f$ has a **unique subgradient** at $x$, then $f$ is **differentiable** at $x$.
