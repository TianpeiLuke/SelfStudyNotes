## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:   Supporting Hyperplane of Convex Set

>[!important] Definition
>A *closed hyperplane* $H$ in a *normed space* $X$ is said to be a **supporting hyperplane** (or a **support**) for the **convex set** $K$ if $K$ is *contained* in **one** of the *closed half-spaces* determined by $H$ and $H$ contains *a point* of $\overline{K}$.
