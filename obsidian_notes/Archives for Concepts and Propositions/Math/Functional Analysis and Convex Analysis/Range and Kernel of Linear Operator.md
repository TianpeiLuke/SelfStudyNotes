## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Range and Kernel of Linear Operator


>[!important] Definition
>Let $T \in \mathcal{L}(X, Y)$.  The set of vectors $y \in Y$ so that $y = Tx$ for some $x \in X$ is  called the **range of $T$**; that is,
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \text{\emph{Ran}}(T) := \set{y \in Y: y = Tx}.
> \end{align*}
>$$  
>Note that $\text{Ran}(T) \subseteq Y$ is a **subspace** of $Y$, and $\text{Ran }T$ may *not be closed*.
