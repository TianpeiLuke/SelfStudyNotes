## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Weak Convergence in Banach Space, or *Convergence under Weak Topology*


>[!important] Definition
>A sequence $(x_n)$ in a *normed space* $X$ is said to be **weakly convergent** if there is an $x \in X$ such that **for every $f \in X^{*}$**,
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty} f(x_n) = f(x).
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
>
>This is written $x_n \stackrel{w}{\rightarrow} x$ or $x_n \rightharpoonup x$. 
>

>[!important]
>The element $x$ is called **the weak limit** of $(x_n)$, and we say that $(x_n)$ **converges weakly** to $x$.

>[!info]
>Note that this convergence definition for **points** $x_{n} \in X$ , not for the **functions** $f\in X^{*}$. 

>[!info]
>Weak convergence of *points* holds for all functionals acted on such points.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>**Weak convergence** has various applications throughout analysis (for instance, in the **calculus of variations**, the general theory of **differential equations** and **probability theory.** 


>[!important]
>The concept illustrates a **basic principle of functional analysis**, namely, 
>>[!quote]
>>the fact that the investigation of **spaces** is often related to that of their **dual spaces**, i.e. **probing a variable by using a test functional**.

## Convergence under Weak Topology


>[!info]
>*Weak Convergence* is also called the *Convergence under Weak Topology.*

- [[Weak Topology of Banach Space]]

>[!info]
>Thus a **neighborhood base** *at zero* for *the weak topology* is given by the sets of the form
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \bigcup_{\text{ for any finite }n} \mathcal{N}(f_1 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, f_n; \epsilon) &= \bigcup_{\text{ for any finite }n} \set{x: \lvert f_{j}(x) \rvert  <\epsilon; \; j= 1 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, n}
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
>that is, neighborhoods of zero contain **cylinders** with **finite-dimensional** *open bases*. 


>[!info]
>The definition of convergence is with respect to the underlying topology. A sequence $(x_n)$ **converge to $x$ under weak topology** in a Banach space $X$ means that
>
>There exists some $x\in X$ such that for any $\epsilon >0$, there exists some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, such that, for all $m \ge n$,
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> x_{m} \in \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{F}, \epsilon)(x)
> \end{align*}
> $$
>where $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{F}, \epsilon)(x)$ is *a neighborhood base at $x$* under **the weak topology** generated by $\mathcal{F}$ 

>[!info]
>To prove weak convergence, we only need to verify the convergence over the choice of **any finite collection** of functions.


## Finite Dimensional Space

>[!important]
>In **finite dimensional normed spaces**, the distinction between **strong** and **weak** *convergence* disappears completely. 

## Weak Convergence in Hilbert Space

- Due to existence of *orthonormal basis* in Hilbert Space, the weak topology on Hilbert Space has special form.
