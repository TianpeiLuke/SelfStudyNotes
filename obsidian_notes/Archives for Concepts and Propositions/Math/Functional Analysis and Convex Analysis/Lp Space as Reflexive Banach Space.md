## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Lp Space as Reflexive Banach Space

 ![[Riesz Representation Theorem for Dual of Lp#^b582b1]]

>[!important] Theorem
> Let $(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{F}, \mu)$ be a **$\sigma$-finite measure space**, $1\le p < \infty$.
> 
> Then $L^p(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{F}, \mu)$ is a **reflexive Banach space**.
