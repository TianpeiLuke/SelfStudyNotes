## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Uniform Boundedness Theorem


>[!important] Theorem
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be **Banach spaces** and let $B(\cdot,  \cdot): X\times Y \to \mathbb{C}$ be a **separately** **continuous** *bilinear mapping*, that is, it is a **bounded** linear transformation if *one* of the two arguments is *fixed*. 
>
>Then $B(\cdot,  \cdot)$ is **jointly continuous**, that is, 
>$$
>(x_n \rightarrow 0) \; \land \; (y_n \rightarrow 0) \implies B(x_n, y_n) \rightarrow 0
