## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Dual of $L^p$ Space

![[Riesz Representation Theorem for Dual of Lp#^b582b1]]


>[!important] Definition
> Let $(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{F}, \mu)$ be a **$\sigma$-finite measure space**, $1\le p < \infty$, and $q$ is **HÃ¶lder conjugate** to $p$, i.e. $$\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1.$$
> 
> The **dual normed space** of  $L^{p}(\mathcal{X}, \mu)$ is *isometric isomorphic* to $L^q(\mathcal{X}, \mu)$
> $$
> L^{q}(\mathcal{X}, \mu) \simeq \left(L^{p}(\mathcal{X}, \mu)\right)^{*}.
> $$

## Explanation

>[!important]
>The condition on **$\sigma$-finiteness** of measure space is critical. 
>
>For instance, with **$\sigma$-finite** $(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{F}, \mu)$,  
> $$
> L^{1}(\mathcal{X}, \mu) \simeq \left(L^{\infty}(\mathcal{X}, \mu)\right)^{*}.
> $$ 
> 
>But in general, without this additional assumption
>$$
>\mathcal{BFA}(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{F}, \mu) \simeq \left(L^{\infty}(\mathcal{X}, \mu)\right)^{*}
>$$
>where $\mathcal{BFA}(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{F}, \mu)$ is the space of **bounded finitely additive signed measures** that are **absolutely continuous** with respect to $\mu$,
