## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Open Mapping Theorem

>[!important] Open Mapping Theorem
>Let $T: X \rightarrow Y$ be a **surjective** **bounded linear transformation** of one **Banach space** $X$  *onto* another **Banach space** $Y$.  
>
>Then $T$ is an **open map**. That is,  if $M$ is an **open** set in $X$, $T(M)$ is **open** in $Y$.
