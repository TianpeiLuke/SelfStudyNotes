## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  $\mathcal{F}$-Weak Topology on Vector Space


>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be vector space and let $\mathcal{F} \subset X^{*}$ be a family of *linear functionals* on $X$ that **separates points** of $X$. That is, given any $x, y \in X$, we can find $f\in \mathcal{F}$ such that 
>$$
>f(x) \neq f(y).
>$$
>
>Then the **$\mathcal{F}$-weak topology** on $X$ is the weakest topology on $X$ in which all functionals in $\mathcal{F}$ is *continuous*.
>
>Denote **$\mathcal{F}$-weak topology** on $X$  as $$\sigma(X, \mathcal{F}).$$

## Explanation

>[!important]
>Since we assume that $\mathcal{F}$ **separate points**, the space $X$ under *the $\sigma(X, \mathcal{F})$ topology* is a **Hausdorff space**.

- [[Hausdorff Space]]

>[!example]
>The **weak topology** on $X$ is $$\sigma(X, X^{*})$$ topology.

- [[Weak Topology of Banach Space]]

>[!example]
>The **weak$^{*}$ topology** on $X^{*}$ is $$\sigma(X^{*}, X)$$ topology.

>[!example]
>Let $X$ be a vector space, and $\mathcal{F}$ be space of linear functionals on $X$.
>
 >The space $X$  under the $\sigma(X, \mathcal{F})$-topology (*$\mathcal{F}$-weak topology*) is a **locally convex space.**
 >
 >The **semi-norm** is defined as 
 >$$
 >q_{f}(x) := \lvert f(x) \rvert,\;\quad f \in \mathcal{F} \subset X^{*}.
