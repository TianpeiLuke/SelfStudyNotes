## Explanation

>[!info]
>Recall that a topological space $X$ is
> 
> - **connected** if there do not exist two *disjoint*, *nonempty*, *open* subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$;
> - **path-connected** if every pair of points in $X$ can be *joined by a path* in $X$, and
> - **locally (path-)connected** if $X$ has a *basis* of *(path-)connected* open subsets.
> 
> We have $$\text{\emph{\textbf{path-connected}}} \Rightarrow \text{\emph{\textbf{connected}}}$$ but $$\text{\emph{\textbf{connected}}} \not\Rightarrow \text{\emph{\textbf{locally-connected}}}.$$
