## Highlights

>[!important] Eidelheit's Separation Theorem
>Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be **convex sets** in $X$ such that $K_1$ has *interior points* and $K_2$ contains *no interior point of $K_1$.*
>
>Then there is a **closed hyperplane** $H$ **separating** $K_1$ and $K_2$; i.e., there exists $f \in X^{*}$ such that 
>$$
> \begin{align}
> \sup_{x \in K_1}f(x) &\le \inf_{x \in K_2}f(x) 
> \end{align}
>$$ 
>
>In other words, $K_1$ and $K_2$ lie in *opposite half-spaces* determined by $H$.


>[!important]
>The **support functional** of a *convex set* $K$ **completely specifies the set** (to within *closure*}
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \overline{K} &= \bigcap_{f \in X^{*}}\set{x: f(x) \le h(f)}.
> \end{align*}
