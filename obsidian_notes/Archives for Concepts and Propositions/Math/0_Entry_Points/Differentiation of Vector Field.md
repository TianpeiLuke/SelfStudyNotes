##  List of Concepts

### Lie Derivative

>[!info]
>**Lie derivative** measure the **directional derivative** of **tangent vector fields** *along the* **flow** of another *tangent vector fields*.
>
>The key is to use a **flow** on smooth manifold to define the **direction** in the **directional derivative**

### Exterior Derivative

>[!info]
>**Exterior derivative** operates on the alternating tensor field, i.e. it is a *generalization* of **differential** of *function* to the space of **multi-linear functions**.

### Covariant Derivative

>[!info]
>**Covariant derivative** measure the **directional derivative** of **sections of vector bundle** *along the* **tangent direction** defined by *tangent vector fields*.
>
>The idea is to **project** the directional derivative from *ambient vector space* to **the tangent space of the submanifold.**
