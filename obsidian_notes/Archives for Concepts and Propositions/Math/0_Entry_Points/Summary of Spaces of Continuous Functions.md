##  List of Concepts

- $\mathcal{C}(X)$ i.e. [[Space of all Continuous Functions]]
- $\mathcal{BC}(X)$ i.e. [[Space of Bounded Continuous Function]]
- $\mathcal{C}_{0}(X)$ i.e. [[Continuous Functions that Vanish At Infinity]]
- $\mathcal{C}_{c}(X)$ i.e. [[Continuous Functions with Compact Support]]

### Other Continuity

- [[Lipschitz Continuous Function]]
- [[Absolutely Continuous Function]]
- [[Hölder Condition and Hölder Continuous Function]]
- [[Bounded Variation Function]]
- [[Locally Bounded Variation Function]]
- [[Convex Function]]
