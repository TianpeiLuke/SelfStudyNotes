## Explanation

>[!important]
>For *locally compact Hausdorff space* $X$, the above theorem shows the **duality** between
>- the space of *continuous functions* *vanishing at infinity*  $\mathcal{C}_{0}(X)$ and 
>- the space of *bounded signed Radon measures* $\mathcal{M}(X)$.
>$$\mathcal{M}(X) \simeq (\mathcal{C}_{0}(X))^{*} $$


>[!important]
 >The Riesz-Markov Representation Theorem provides an **integral representation** of a *bounded linear functional* on $\mathcal{C}_{0}(X)$.
 >$$
 >I(\cdot) := \int_{X} \; \cdot \; d\mu_{I}

>[!important]
>$$
>\begin{CD}
> \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X}) @>\subset>> \mathcal{BA}(\mathcal{X})\\ 
>@VV*V  @VV* V\\ 
> \mathcal{C}_{0}(\mathcal{X}) @>\subset>> L^{\infty}(\mathcal{X}, \mu)
>\end{CD}
