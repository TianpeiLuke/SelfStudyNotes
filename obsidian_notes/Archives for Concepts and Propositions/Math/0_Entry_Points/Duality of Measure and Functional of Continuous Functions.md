## Explanation

>[!important]
>For *locally compact Hausdorff space* $X$, the above theorem shows the **duality** between
>- the space of *continuous functions* *vanishing at infinity*  $\mathcal{C}_{0}(X)$ and 
>- the space of *signed Radon measures* $\mathcal{M}(X)$.
>$$\mathcal{M}(X) \simeq (\mathcal{C}_{0}(X))^{*} $$


>[!important]
 >The Riesz-Markov Representation Theorem provides an **integral representation** of a *bounded linear functional* on $\mathcal{C}_{0}(X)$.
 >$$
 >I(\cdot) := \int_{X} \; \cdot \; d\mu_{I}
