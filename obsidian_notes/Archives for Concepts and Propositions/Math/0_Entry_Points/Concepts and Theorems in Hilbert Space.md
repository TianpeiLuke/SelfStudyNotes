## Explanation

>[!important]
>Hilbert space is a **natural extension** of Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ to infinite dimensional space, i.e function space. 
>
>Hilbert space inherits a lot of properties in *Euclidean geometry*:
>- Definition of **angle**, **length** and **distance**.
>- Endowment of **a coordinate system** with an *orthonormal basis*.
>- Unique **projection** on closed subspace.
>- Equivalence of **(bounded) linear map** with **vector**. 

>[!important]
>**The spectrum theorem** for *self-adjoint operator* on Hilbert space is a natural extension of **the eigen-decomposition** of *Hermitian matrix* in finite dimensional vector space.
>- Each Hermitian matrix represents a **compact self-adjoint operator** on finite dimensional vector space.
