## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Martingale


>[!info] Definition
>Let $\{X_n, n \ge 0\}$ be a stochastic process on a measure space $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$.
>
>A collection of $\sigma$-fields $\{\mathscr{F}_n, n \ge 0\}$ are called a **filtration**, if $\{\mathscr{F}_n, n \ge 0\}$ is an *increasing sub $\sigma$-fields* of $\mathscr{F}$
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \mathscr{F}_0 \subseteq \mathscr{F}_1 \subseteq \mathscr{F}_2  \,{\subseteq}\ldots{\subseteq}\, \mathscr{F}.

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\{X_n, n \ge 0\}$ be a stochastic process on a measure space $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$, and $\{\mathscr{F}_n, n \ge 0\}$ be a **filtration**.
>
>$\{ (X_n, \mathscr{F}_n),  n \ge 0\}$ is a **martingale** *(mg)* if
> 
> -  $X_n$ is **adapted** in the sense that for each $n$, *$X_n \in \mathscr{F}_n$*;  that is, $X_n$ is **$\mathscr{F}_n$-measurable.**
> -  For $n \ge 0$, $X_n \in L^1(\Omega, \mathscr{F}_{n})$; that is, $X_{n}$ is **absolutely integrable.** 
>   $$\mathbb{E}\left[ \lvert X_{n} \rvert  \right] < \infty, \text{ for } n \ge 0.$$
> - For $0 \le m < n$, the following **martingale equation** holds

## Explanation

>The inequality

> \mathbb{E}\left[ X_{n} \;|\; \mathscr{F}_{m} \right] &\le X_m, \quad \text{a.s.}

> states that given information in the past (i.e. $\mathscr{F}_{m}, m \le n$), *the current expected rewards* (i.e. $X_{n}$) would **stay the same** as compared to *the reward received in the past* ($X_{m}$).
> 
>In order word, for a martingale, the information contained at each sub-$\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{F}_{m}$ is **_sufficient_ to make the prediction on rewards at that moment**. 

>[!info]
>A martingale represents a **fair game**, and the players *stands a chance to win* in the long run.

>[!info]
>The definition of martingale assumes a situation where *the information is shared and transparent to all parties* in a fair repeated game. 


>[!important]
>$\{ (X_n, \mathscr{F}_n),  n \ge 0\}$ is a **martingale** if it is both a **super-martingale** and a **sub-martingale**.

## Properties

>[!important] Proposition
>If  $\{ (X_n, \mathscr{F}_n),  n \ge 0\}$ is a **(sub, super) martingale**, then 
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \set{ (X_n, \sigma \left(X_0, X_1 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, X_n \right)),  n \ge 0}
> \end{align*} 
>$$ 
>is also a **(sub, super) martingale**.

>[!info]
>Note that $$\sigma(X_{n}) \subseteq \mathscr{F}_{n} $$ and $$\sigma(X_{n}) \subseteq \sigma\left(X_{0} \,{,}\ldots{,}\, X_{n}\right)$$

## Examples

>[!example] The Sum of Independent Random Variables
>Suppose that $\set{Z_n, n \ge 0}$ is an **independent** sequence of *integrable centered random variables* satisfying for $n \ge 0$,  $\mathbb{E}[Z_n] = 0$.  Set
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> X_0 &:= 0,\\
> X_n &:= \sum_{i=1}^{n}Z_i, \quad n \ge 1 \\
> \mathscr{F}_n &:= \sigma\left(Z_0 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, Z_n\right).
> \end{align*} 
>$$ 
> Then $\set{(X_n, \mathscr{F}_n), n \ge 0}$ is a **martingale** and $\set{(Z_n, \mathscr{F}_n), n \ge 0}$ is a **martingale difference sequence.**

>[!important]
>The concept of a **martingale** is a **generalization** to the sequence of **independent random variables**, since it does not require independence among $X_{n}$ but still maintain the *orthogonality in expectation* among $X_{n} - X_{n-1}$.
