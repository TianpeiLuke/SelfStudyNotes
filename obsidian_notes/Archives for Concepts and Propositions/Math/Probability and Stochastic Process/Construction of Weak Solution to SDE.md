## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Construction of Weak Solution to SDE



>[!quote]
>Solutions to SDEs or diffusions can be realized on **the probability space of continuous functions**. We indicate: how to *define probability* on this space by means of a *transition function*, how to *find the transition function* from the *given SDE* and how to *verify* that the constructed process indeed satisfies the given SDE.
