## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Random Element


>[!important] Definition
>Given  $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$ and $(\Omega', \mathscr{B})$ are two *measurable space*, a map $X: \Omega \rightarrow \Omega'$ is a *measurable map* (or *$(\mathscr{F}/\mathscr{B})$ measurable*) if
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> X^{-1}(\mathscr{B}) \subset \mathscr{F}.
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
>$X$ is called a **random element** in $\Omega'$, and denoted as
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> X\in \mathscr{F}/\mathscr{B}, \\
> \text{or } X: (\Omega, \mathscr{F}) \rightarrow (\Omega', \mathscr{B})
> \end{align*}
>$$

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Random Variable

>[!important] Definition
>If $$(\Omega', \mathscr{B}) = (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}),$$ where $\mathcal{B} = \mathscr{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is *Borel $\sigma$-algebra* on $\mathbb{R}$, then $X$ is called a **random variable**.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>A random variable is a real-valued $\mathscr{F}$-measurable function.

>[!info]
>We can interpret each *random variable* $X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as the result of a **random experiment** whose **outcome measurement** is a *real number*. 

>[!info]
>When the *experiment design* is *complete*, the random variable as a $\mathscr{F}$-measurable function is *fixed*, and the *outcome* for each run is associated with a specific *sample point* $\omega\in \Omega$.

>[!info]
>- The *$\sigma$-algebra* *generated by a random variable* $X$, $\sigma(X)$, *encodes* **all possible information** conveyed by the *outcome of experiment* $X$.  
>
>- In communication, where $X$ is the message, all information of the message can be encoded in $\sigma(X)$.  


>[!info]  
>The set $\left[  X\in A \right]  \equiv \set{\omega: X(\omega)\in A}\in \sigma(X)$ incorporates *all possible realizations* whose outcomes lie in $A$.
