## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Generator of Stochastic Differential Equation



>[!important]
>$$
>\begin{align*}
>L &:=  b^i\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x^i } + a^{i,j}\frac{ \partial^2  }{ \partial x^i\,x^{j} }
>\end{align*} 
>$$
>Here we used the **Einstein summation convention**.
