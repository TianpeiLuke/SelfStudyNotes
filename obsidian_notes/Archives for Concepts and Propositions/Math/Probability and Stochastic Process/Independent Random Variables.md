## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Independent Random Variables


>[!important] Definition
>Suppose  $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mathcal{P})$ is a fixed *probability space.* 
>
>$\{X_t, t \in T\}$ is an **independent family** of *random variables* if $\{\sigma(X_t),\, t \in T\}$ are **independent** *$\sigma$-algebras.*
>
>That is, for any $\left\{ A_{t}, t\in T \right\}$ where $A_{t} \in \sigma(X_{t})$, we have  $\left\{ A_{t}, t\in T \right\}$ are *independent events.*
