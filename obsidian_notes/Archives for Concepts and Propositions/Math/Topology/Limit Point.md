## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Limit Point


>[!important] Definition
>If $A$ is a subset of the topological space $X$ and if $x$ is a point of $X$, we say that $x$ is a **limit point** (or **cluster point**, or **point of accumulation**) of $A$ if *every neighborhood* of $x$ *intersects* $A$ in some point *other than* $x$ itself. 



>[!important] Definition
>Said differently, $x$ is **a limit point** of $A$ if it belongs to *the closure* of $A \setminus \{x\}$. The point $x$ may lie in $A$ or not; for this definition it does not matter.
