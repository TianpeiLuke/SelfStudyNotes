## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Vertex Point of Polyhedron

>[!important] Definition
>Let $P$ be a *polyhedron*. 
>
>A vector $x\in P$ is a **vertex** of $P$ if there exists some $c\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $$\left\langle c ,  x\right\rangle \le \left\langle c ,  y\right\rangle$$ for all $y\in P$ such that $y\neq x.$
>
>In other words, $x$ is a **vertex** of $P$ *if and only if* P is on **one side** of a *hyperplane*.
