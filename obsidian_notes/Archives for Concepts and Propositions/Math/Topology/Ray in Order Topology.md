## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Ray in Order Topology

>[!important] Definition
>If $X$ is an *ordered set*, and $a$ is an element of $X$, there are four subsets of $X$ that are called **the rays** *determined by* $a$. 
>
>They are the following:
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> (a, +\infty) = \{x:  x > a\},\\
> (-\infty, a) = \{x:  x < a\},\\
> [a, +\infty) = \{x: x \ge a\},\\
> (-\infty, a]= \{x: x \le a\}.
> \end{align*}
>$$
>- Sets of the *first two* types are called **open rays**, and 
>- sets of the *last two types* are called **closed rays**.
