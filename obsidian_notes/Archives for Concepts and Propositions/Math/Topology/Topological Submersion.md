## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Topological Submersion


>[!important] Definition
>If $M$ and $N$ are topological spaces, a *continuous map* $$\pi: M \rightarrow N$$ is called a **topological submersion** if *every point* of $M$ is in the *image* of a **(continuous) local section** of $\pi$.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>For every $p \in M$, there exists $q \in N$ such that
>$$
>\sigma(q) = p;\quad \pi\circ \sigma(q) = q \implies \pi(p) = q
