## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Topological $n$-Manifold


>[!important] Definition
>Suppose $M$ is a *topological space*. We say that $M$ is a **topological manifold** of **dimension $n$** or a **topological $n$-manifold** if it has the following properties:
>
> 1. $M$ is a **Hausdorff space**: 
>    for every pair of *distinct points* $p, q \in M$, there are *disjoint open subsets* $U, V \subseteq M$ such that $p \in U$ and $q \in V$.
>    
> 2. $M$ is **second-countable**: 
>    there exists a *countable basis* for the topology of $M$.
>    
> 3. $M$ is **locally Euclidean** of *dimension $n$*: 
>    each point of $M$ has a *neighborhood* that is *homeomorphic* to an *open* subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

## Explanation



## Proporties

>[!important] Theorem
>A nonempty *$n$-dimensional topological manifold* cannot be **homeomorphic** to an $m$-dimensional manifold **unless** $m = n$.

>[!info]
>This means that **the dimension** of a topological manifold is *well-defined*.

>[!important]
>**The dimension** of a topological manifold $M$ is denoted as $\text{dim}\,M$.
