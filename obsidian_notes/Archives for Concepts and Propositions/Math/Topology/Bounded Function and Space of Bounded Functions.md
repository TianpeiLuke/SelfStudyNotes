## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Bounded Function and the space of all Bounded Functions $\mathcal{B}(X, Y)$


>[!important] Definition
>Let $Y$ be a *metric space* with metric $d$. 
>
>A map $F: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to be **bounded** if its image set is *bounded* in $Y$, i.e. there exists some value $r >0$ such that for any two points $y_{1}, y_{2} \in F(X)$,  
>$$ d(y_{1}, y_{2}) < r.$$

>[!important]
>*The space of all bounded functions* from $X$ to $Y$ is denoted as $\mathcal{B}(X, Y)$.
