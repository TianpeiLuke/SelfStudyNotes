## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Countably Locally Finiteness


>[!important] Definition
>A collection $\mathscr{B}$ of subsets of $X$ is said to be **countably locally finite** if $\mathscr{B}$ can be written as *the countable union* of collections $\mathscr{B}_n$, each of which is *locally finite*. 
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \mathscr{B} &= \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}\mathscr{B}_{n}
> \end{align*}
> $$ 
>Countably locally finite is also called **$\sigma$-locally finite**.
