## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Absorbing  Set


>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be a vector space.  
>
>A *subset* $C \subset X$ is called **absorbing** or **absorbent**, if 
>$$
>X = \bigcup_{\lambda >0}\lambda C.
>$$
>
>That is, for every $x \in X$,  there exists some $\lambda >0$ such that
>$$
>\lambda x \in C.
