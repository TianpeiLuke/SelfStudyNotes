## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  The space of continuous functions with compact support $\mathcal{C}_{c}(X, Y)$


>[!important] Definition
>Define the **support** of a function $f$, $\text{supp}(f)$ as  the *smallest closed set* *outside* of which  $f$ *vanishes*. 
>
>The subset $\mathcal{C}_{c}(X) \subseteq \mathcal{C}(X)$ is the space of all *continuous functions* with **compact support**
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \mathcal{C}_{c}(X) &= \set{f \in \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R}): \text{supp }(f) \text{\emph{ is compact}}}.
> \end{align*} 
>$$


## Explanation

>[!info]
>Let $\mathcal{C}_c(X, \mathbb{R}) \subset \mathcal{C}_{0}(X, \mathbb{R})  \subset \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$.

>[!info]
>Note that by *Tietze Extension Theorem*, **the locally compact Hausdorff space** $X$ has a rich supply of *continuous functions* that *vanishes outside a compact set.*
