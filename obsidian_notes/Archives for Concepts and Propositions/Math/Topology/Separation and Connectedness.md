## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Separation and Connectedness


>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be a *topological space*. A **separation** of $X$ is a pair $U$, $V$ of *disjoint* nonempty *open* subsets of $X$ whose *union* is $X$. 
>
>The space $X$ is said to be **connected** if there **does not exist a separation** of $X$.


>[!important] Equivalent Definition
>Equivalently, $X$ is **connected** if and only if the only subsets of $X$ that are *both open and closed* are $\emptyset$ and $X$ itself.
