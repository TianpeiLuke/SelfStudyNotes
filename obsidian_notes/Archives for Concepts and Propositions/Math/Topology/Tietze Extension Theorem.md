## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**:   Tietze Extension Theorem

>[!important] The Tietze Extension Theorem
>Let $X$ be a **normal space**; let $A$ be a **closed** *subspace* of $X$.
> 
> - Any **continuous** map of $A$ *into* the *closed interval* $[a, b]$ of $\mathbb{R}$ may be **extended** to a *continuous* map of *all of $X$* into $[a, b]$.
> - Any **continuous** map of $A$ into $\mathbb{R}$ may be **extended** to a **continuous** map of **all of $X$** into $\mathbb{R}$.

## Explanation



## Generalization

>[!info]
>We can see that in functional analysis, **the Hahn-Banach theorem** also extends the domain of a linear functional from a subspace to the entire space. [[Hahn-Banach Theorem Extension Form]]
