## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Open Map

>[!important] Definition
>A map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ (*continuous or not*) is said to be an **open map** if for *every open* subset $U \subseteq X$, the *image* set $f(U)$ is *open* in $Y$.






## Explanation

>[!info]
>If $f: X\to Y$ is **open map**, then 
>$$
>U \text{ open in }X \implies f(U) \text{ open in } Y
>$$
>
>It is the reverse of the **continuous** map
>$$
>W \text{ open in } Y \implies f^{-1}(W) \text{ open in }X
>$$
