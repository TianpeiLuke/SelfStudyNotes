## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  The Tychonoff Theorem


>[!important] The Tychonoff Theorem
>An **arbitrary product** of **compact spaces** is **compact** in the *product topology.*

- [[Product Topology]]



## Explanation

>[!important] Tube Lemma 
>Consider the product space $X \times Y$, where $Y$ is **compact**. 
>
>If $N$ is an *open set* of $X \times Y$ containing the **slice** $$x_0 \times Y$$ of $X \times Y$, then $N$ *contains some* **tube** $$W \times Y$$ *about* $x_0 \times Y$, where $W$ is a **neighborhood** of $x_0$ in $X$.
