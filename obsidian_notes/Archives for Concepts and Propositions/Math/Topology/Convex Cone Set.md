## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Convex Cone Set


>[!important] Definition
>A set $A$ in a *vector space* $X$ is called a **convex cone**, if it is both **convex** and a **cone.**



## Explanation

>[!info]
>for any $x, y \in A$, and $0 \leq t \leq 1$, we have
>$$
>tx + (1-t)y \in A;\quad tx \in A.
