## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Regular Space $T_3$


>[!important] Definition
>Suppose that *one-point sets are closed* in $X$ (i.e. $X$ is $T_1$ space). Then $X$ is said to be **regular ($T_3$)** if for *each pair* consisting of *a point* $x$ and *a closed set* $B$ *disjoint* from $x$, there exist *disjoint open sets* containing $x$ and $B$, respectively.
