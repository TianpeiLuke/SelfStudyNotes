## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  The space of continuous functions that vanish at infinity $\mathcal{C}_0(X, Y)$


>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be a space. A subset $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$ is said to **vanish _uniformly_ at infinity** if given $\epsilon > 0$, there is a *compact subspace* $C$ of $X$ such that $$|f(x)| < \epsilon$$  for $x \in X \setminus C$ and $f \in \mathcal{F}$. 


>[!important] Definition
>If $\mathcal{F}$ consists of *a single function* $f$, we say simply that **$f$ vanishes at infinity**. That is, given $\epsilon > 0$, there is a *compact subspace* $C$ of $X$ such that $$|f(x)| < \epsilon$$  for $x \in X \setminus C.$


>[!important] Definition
>Let $\mathcal{C}_0(X, \mathbb{R}) \subset \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$ denote **the space of continuous functions** that **vanish at infinity**.
