## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Generalized $m$-dimensional Simplex

>[!important] Definition
>Let $x_{0} \,{,}\ldots{,}\, x_{m}$ be $(m+1)$ *affinely independent* points. Then the set 
>$$
>\Delta_{m} := \text{conv}\left(\left\{ x_{0} \,{,}\ldots{,}\, x_{m} \right\}  \right)
>$$
>is called a **$m$-dimensional simplex** and $x_{0} \,{,}\ldots{,}\, x_{m}$ are called **ordinary vertices** of the simplex.

>[!important] Definition
>$\Delta_{m}$ is called **generalized $m$-dimensional simplex** if some of vertices are *free vectors* $v_{i} \in V$. These vertices are called **the vertices at infinity.**
