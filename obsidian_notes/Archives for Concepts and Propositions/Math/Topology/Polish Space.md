## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Polish Space

>[!important]
>A *topological space* $X$ is called **Polish space** if it is a **separable**, **completely metrizable** space.
>
>That is $X$ is *homemorphic* to a **complete metric space** that has **countable dense subset**.

- [[Complete Metric Space]]
- [[Metrizable Space]]


## Explanation


>[!example]
>A **separable Hilbert space** is a Polish space.

- [[Separable Hilbert Space]]

>[!example]
>A **separable Banach space** is a Polish space.



>[!example]
>A **compact Hausdorff space** with countable basis is metrizable. Thus, if furthermore, it is **separable** and is **complete** under induced metric, it is Polish space.
