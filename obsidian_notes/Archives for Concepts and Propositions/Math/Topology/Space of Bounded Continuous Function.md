## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  The space of all Bounded Continuous Functions $\mathcal{BC}(X, Y)$



>[!important]
>*The space of all bounded continuous functions* from $X$ to $Y$ is denoted as $\mathcal{BC}(X, Y)$.
>
>$$\mathcal{BC}(X, Y) = \mathcal{B}(X, Y) \cap \mathcal{C}(X, Y)$$

## Explanation

>[!info]
>$$\mathcal{BC}(X, Y) \subset \mathcal{B}(X, Y)$$
>is a **closed** subspace of $\mathcal{B}(X,Y)$.
