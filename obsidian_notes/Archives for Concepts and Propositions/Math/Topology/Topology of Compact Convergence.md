## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  *The Topology of Compact Convergence* or *Topology of Uniform Convergence on Compact Sets*

>[!important] Definition
>Let $(Y, d)$ be a *metric space*; let $X$ be a *topological space*. Given an element $f$ of $Y^X$, a **compact subspace** $C$ of $X$, and a number $\epsilon > 0$, let $B_{C}(f, \epsilon)$ denote the set of all those elements $g$ of $Y^X$ for which
>$$
>\begin{align*}
>\sup\{d(f (x), g(x)): x \in C\} < \epsilon.
>\end{align*}
>$$
The sets $B_{C}(f, \epsilon)$  form a *basis* for a topology on $Y^X$. It is called the **topology of compact convergence** (or sometimes the "**topology of uniform convergence on compact sets**").

- This definition *requires $Y$ to be metric space*, not just a general topological space. 
- Also this definition requires $X$ to be a *topological space*. 
- Compare to *uniform convergence*, this definition is *restricted* within *a compact subset*.



## Explanation

>[!info]
>*Topology of Compact Convergence* generated by the **basis**
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> B_{C}(f, \epsilon) &= \set{g \in Y^X: \sup_{x \in C}d(f (x), g(x)) < \epsilon }.
> \end{align*}
> $$
>It corresponds to **the uniform convergence** of $f_n$ to $f$ in $Y^X$ for $x \in C$.

>[!info]
>$\mathcal{C}(X, Y)$ is **closed** in $Y^X$ under the *topology of compact convergence* **if $X$ is compactly generated**.
