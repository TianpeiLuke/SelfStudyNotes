## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Locally Convex Space


>[!info] Definition of Semi-norms
>A **semi-norm** on a vector space $X$ is a mapping $q: X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+}$ satisfying the following conditions: 
> 1. **homogeneity**: $q(\gamma \mathbf{x}) = |\gamma| q(\mathbf{x})$;
> 2. **the triangle inequality**: $q(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y})\le q(\mathbf{x})+ q(\mathbf{y})$.

>[!info] Definition
>A family of semi-norms $\{ q_{\alpha} \}_{\alpha\in I}$ is said to **separate points** if 
>$$
>q_{\alpha}(x) = 0, \;\; \forall \alpha \in I \implies x = 0
>$$

>[!important] Definition
>A **locally convex space** is a vector space $X$ over field $F$ (e.g. $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) with a family  $\{ q_{\alpha} \}_{\alpha\in I}$ of *semi-norms* *separating points*. 

>[!important] Definition
>The **natural topology** on a locally convex space is the *weakest topology* in which all $q_{\alpha}$ are *continuous* and in which **the operation of addition** is *continuous*.

## Explanation

>[!important] Proposition
>The natural topology of a locally convex space is **Hausdorff**.

## Example


>[!example]
>Let $X$ be a vector space, and $\mathcal{F}$ be space of linear functionals on $X$.
>
 >The space $X$  under the $\sigma(X, \mathcal{F})$-topology (*$\mathcal{F}$-weak topology*) is a **locally convex space.**
 >
 >The **semi-norm** is defined as 
 >$$
 >q_{f}(x) := \lvert f(x) \rvert,\;\quad f \in \mathcal{F} \subset X^{*}.  
 >$$

## Characteristic of Locally Convex Set


>[!important] Theorem
>Let $X$ be a topological vector space with a **Hausdorff** topology in which the vector addition and scalar multiplication are both continuous functions. 
>
>Then $X$ is a **locally convex space** *if and only if* $0$ has a *neighborhood base* of **balanced**, **convex** and **absorbing** sets (i.e. absorbing disks).
