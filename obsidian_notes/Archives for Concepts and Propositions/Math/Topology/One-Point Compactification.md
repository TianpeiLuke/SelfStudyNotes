## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  One-Point Compactification


>[!important] Definition
>If $Y$ is a **compact Hausdorff** space and $X$ is a proper *subspace* of $Y$ whose *closure* equals $Y$, i.e.
>$$
>X \subset Y; \qquad \overline{X} = Y
>$$ 
>then $Y$ is said to be a **compactification** of $X$. 
>
>If $Y\setminus X$ equals **a single point**, then $Y$ is called the **one-point compactification** of $X$.
