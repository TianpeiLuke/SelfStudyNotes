## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Lebesgue Number Lemma in Compact Metric Space

>[!important] Lebesgue Number Lemma
>For any **open covering** $\mathscr{A}$ of the **metric space** $(X,d)$. 
>
>If $X$ is **compact**, there exists a **number** $\delta>0$ such that for *any subset* of $X$ having **diameter** $<\delta$, there exists an element of $\mathscr{A}$ **containing** it. 

>[!important] Definition
>Such a number $\delta$ is called a **Lebesgue number** or **Delta number** of this cover. The notion of a Delta number itself is useful in other applications as well.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>This lemma states that there exists an *open covering* containing *open balls* whose *diameter* is at most $\delta$.

>[!info]
>This **delta number** can be used as a *uniform metric* to measure the neighborhood.
