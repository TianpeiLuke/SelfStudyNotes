## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Fréchet Space

>[!important] Definition
>A *complete*, *metrizable*, *locally convex space* is called a **Fréchet space**

- [[Locally Convex Space]]
- [[Complete Metric Space]]
## Explanation

>[!important] Proposition
>Let $X$ be a **locally convex space**. The following are **equivalent**:
>- $X$ is **metrizable**.
>- $0$ has a **countable neighborhood base**.
>- The topology on $X$ is *generated* by some **countable family** of **semi-norms**.
