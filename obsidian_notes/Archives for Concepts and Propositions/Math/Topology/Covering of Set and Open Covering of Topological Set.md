## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Open Covering


>[!important] Definition
>A collection $\mathscr{A}$ of subsets of a space $X$ is said to **cover** $X$, or to be **a covering** of $X$, if *the union of the elements* of $\mathscr{A}$ is *equal* to $X$. 

>[!important] Definition
>It is called an **open covering of $X$** if its elements are *open* subsets of $X$.
