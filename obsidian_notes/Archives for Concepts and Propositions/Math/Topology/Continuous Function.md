## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Continuous Function


>[!important] Definition
>A map $F: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to be **continuous** if for *every open subset* $U \subseteq Y$, the *preimage* $F^{-1}(U)$ is *open* in $X$.

- [[Preimage and Range of Function]]
- [[Topology of Set]]

>[!important] Definition
>The space of all **continuous functions** from X to Y is denoted as $\mathcal{C}(X, Y)$
> $$
> \mathcal{C}(X, Y) = \left\{ f: X \rightarrow Y:  f^{-1}(U) \in \mathscr{T}_{X}, \text{ for every }U\in \mathscr{T}_{Y} \right\}
> $$



## Explanation

>[!important]
>**Continuouity** is a basic property of function that is compatible with the notion of **topology**. 
>
>Given the topology on **domain** and **co-domain**, we can always define a continuous function.
