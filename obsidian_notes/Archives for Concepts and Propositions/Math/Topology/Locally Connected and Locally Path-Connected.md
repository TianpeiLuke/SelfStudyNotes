## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Locally Connected and Locally Path-Connected

>[!important] Definition
>A space $X$ is said to be **locally connected** *at* $x$ if for *every neighborhood* $U$ of $x$, there is a *connected neighborhood* $V$ of $x$ contained in $U$. 
>
>If X is *locally connected* at *each* of its points, it is said simply to be **locally connected**.

>[!important] Definition
> Similarly, a space $X$ is said to be **locally path connected** at $x$ if for every neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is a *path-connected neighborhood* $V$ of $x$ *contained* in $U$. 
> 
> If $X$ is *locally path connected* at *each* of its points, then it is said to be **locally path connected**.
