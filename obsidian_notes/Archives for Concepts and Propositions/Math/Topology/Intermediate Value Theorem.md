## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Intermediate Value Theorem

>[!important] Intermediate Value Theorem
>Let $f : X \rightarrow Y$ be a **continuous** map, where $X$ is a **connected** space and $Y$ is an **ordered** *set* in the **order topology**. 
>
>If $a$ and $b$ are two points of $X$ and if $r$ is a point of $Y$ **lying between** $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there **exists** a point $c$ of $X$ such that $$f(c) = r.$$
