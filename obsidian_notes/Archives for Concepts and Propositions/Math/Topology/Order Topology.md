## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Order Topology

>[!important] Definition
>If $X$ is a **simply ordered set**, there is a *standard topology* for $X$, defined using the *order relation*. 
>
>It is called **the order topology**. The order topology is *generated by* **intervals**.

>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be a set with a *simple order relation*; assume $X$ has more than one element.
>
> Let $\mathscr{B}$ be the collection of all sets of the following types:
>
>- *All open intervals* $(a, b)$ in $X$.
>- *All half intervals* of the form $[a_0,b)$, where $a_0$ is the *smallest element* (if any) of $X$.
>- *All half-intervals* of the form $(a, b_0]$, where $b_0$ is the *largest element* (if any) of $X$.
>
> The collection $\mathscr{B}$ is a *basis* for a topology on $X$, which is called **the order topology**.
