## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Interval in Order Topology

>[!important] Definition
>Suppose that $X$ is a set having a **simple order relation** $<$. Given elements $a$ and $b$ of $X$ such that $$a < b,$$ there are *four subsets* of $X$ that are called the **intervals** *determined by* $a$ and $b$. 
>They are the following :
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> (a,b) = \{x: a < x < b\},\\
> (a,b] = \{x: a < x \le b\},\\
> [a,b) = \{x: a \le x < b\},\\
> [a, b] = \{x: a \le x \le b\}.
> \end{align*}
>$$
> 
>- A set of the *first* type is called an **open interval** in $X$, 
>- a set of the *last* type is called a **closed interval** in $X$, and 
>- sets of *the second* and *third* types are called **half-open intervals**.
