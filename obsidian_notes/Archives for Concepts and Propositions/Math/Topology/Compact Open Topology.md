## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Compact-Open Topology

>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be *topological spaces*. If $C$ is a **compact subspace** of $X$ and $U$ is an *open* subset of $Y$, define
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> S(C,U) = \set{ f \in \mathcal{C}(X, Y): f(C) \subseteq U}.
> \end{align*}
> $$
>The sets $S(C, U)$ form a *subbasis* for a *topology* on $\mathcal{C}(X, Y)$ that is called **the compact-open topology**.


- [[Sub-Basis of Topology]]
- Note that this definition *requires **both** $X$ and $Y$ to be topological space*.
- The subbasis definition uses a *compact subspace* of X
- This topology is on *the space of **continuous** functions* $\mathcal{C}(X, Y)$. 



## Explanation

>[!info]
>- The general *basis* element for this topology is a **finite intersection** of subbasis elements $S(C, U)$. 
>
>- Thus a typical *basis* element about the function $f$ *consists of all continuous functions* $g$ that are  **"uniformly close"** to $f$ within a *finite number of compact subspaces*. 
>  
> - The *compact open topology* is generated by the **basis**
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> B_{U_1, \ldots, U_n}(C_1 , \ldots, C_n)  &= \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}S(C_i, U_i) \\
> &= \set{f \in \mathcal{C}(X, Y): f(C_1) \subset U_1 , \ldots, f(C_n) \subset U_n}, \quad \exists n < \infty.
> \end{align*}$$
>where $C_i \subset X$ are compact subspaces of $X$.


>[!info]
>The definition of *the compact-open topology* does **not** involve a **metric** in $Y$, which is a useful feature.

>[!info]
>it satisfies the requirement of "**joint continuity**.” 
>- Roughly speaking, this means that the expression $f(x)$ is *continuous* *not only* in the *single* "variable”  $x$,  but is **continuous jointly** in *both* the $x$ and $f$ .
