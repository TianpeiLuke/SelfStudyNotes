## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Closed Graph Theorem

>[!important] Closed Graph Theorem
>Let $f : X \rightarrow Y$; let $Y$ be **compact Hausdorff**. 
>
>Then $f$ is **continuous** *if and only if* the **graph** of $f$,
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> G(f) = \set{(x, f(x)):  x\in X},
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
> is **closed** in $X \times Y$.

>[!important] Closed Graph Theorem (Banach Space)
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be **Banach spaces**  and $T$ a **linear map** of $X$ into $Y$. 
>
>Then $T$ is **bounded** *if and only if* the **graph** of  $Î¤$ is **closed**.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>If $f$ is **lower semi-continuous** or **upper semi-continuous**, we have **closed epigraph** or **closed hypograph**, respectively. 
>
>These two conditions hold without assumption on compact Hausdorff.
