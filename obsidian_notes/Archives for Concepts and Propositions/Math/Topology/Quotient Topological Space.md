## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Quotient Topological Space

>[!important] Definition
>Suppose $X$ is a *topological space* and $\sim$ is *an equivalence relation* on $X$. 
>
>Let $X/\sim$ denote *the set of equivalence classes* in $X$, and let $\pi: X \rightarrow X/\sim$ be the **natural projection** sending each *point* to its *equivalence class*. 
>$$
>\pi(x) = [x]
>$$
>
>Endowed with *the quotient topology* determined by $\pi$, the space $X/\sim$ is called **the quotient space** (or **identification space**) of $X$ *determined by* $\pi$.

## Explanation


>[!important] 
>The **quotient topology** on a *quotient set* $X / \sim$  is the *weak topology* generated by the *projection map* $\pi: X \to X/\sim$ 
>$$
>\pi: x \mapsto [x], \quad x\in X.
>$$


>[!info]
>A set of points in $X$ in the **same equivalence class** $[y]$  is considered as **one point** in *quotient space* $X/\sim$. 
>
>Geometrically, it is seen as 
>- **collapsing a set of points** *into* **one** if this set of points are *in a connected neighborhood*, or, 
>- **cut-and paste** *a set of points* **in boundary** *with another* set of points **in boundary**.



## Generalization

>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $X^{*}$ be a **partition** of $X$ into *disjoint subsets* whose union is $X$. 
>
>Let $\pi: X \rightarrow X^*$ be the *surjective map* that carries each point of $X$ to the element of $X^*$ *containing* it. That is, for any $x\in X$, there exists a $U_{x}\in X^{*}$ so that $x\in U_{x}$. Then
>$$
>\pi(x) = U_{x}.
>$$
>Moreover, if $y\not\in U_{x}$, then $\pi(x) \cap \pi(y) = \emptyset.$ 
>
>In **the quotient topology** *induced by* $\pi$, the space $X^*$ is called a **quotient space** of $X$.

## Property

>[!important]
>The **Hausdorff** condition ($T_{2}$ axiom) **does not behave well**; 
>
>even if $X$ is **Hausdorff**, there is no reason that **the quotient space** $X/\sim$ needs to be Hausdorff. 
>
>Conditions that will ensure $X/\sim$ is **Hausdorff** are harder to find.

>[!info]
>There is a simple condition for $X/\sim$ to satisfy the **$T_1$ axiom**; one simply requires that **each element** of **the partition** $X/\sim$ be a **closed subset** of $X$.
