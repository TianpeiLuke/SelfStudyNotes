## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Closure of Set


>[!important] Definition
>Given a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$,  **the closure of $A$** is defined as *the intersection* of all *closed sets* **containing $A$.**
>
>The closure of $A$ is denoted by **$\text{cls}(A)$** or by **$\bar{A}$.**


## Explanation
