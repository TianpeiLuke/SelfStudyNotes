## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Section of Continuous Function


>[!important] Definition
>If $\pi: M \rightarrow N$ is any *continuous map*, a **section** of $\pi$ is a **continuous right inverse** for $\pi$, i.e., a *continuous map* $$\sigma: N \rightarrow M$$ such that $$\pi \circ \sigma = \text{Id}_N$$


>[!important] Definition
>A **local section** of $\pi$ is a *continuous map* $\sigma: U \rightarrow M$ defined on some *open subset* $U \subseteq N$ and satisfying the analogous relation $$\pi \circ \sigma = \text{Id}_U.$$
