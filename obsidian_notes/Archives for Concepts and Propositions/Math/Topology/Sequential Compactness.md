## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Sequential Compactness


>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be a topological space. If $(x_n)$ is a *sequence* of points of $X$, and if
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> n_1 < n_2 < \ldots < n_i < \ldots
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
> is an *increasing* sequence of positive integers, then the sequence $(y_i)$ defined by setting $$y_i = x_{n_i}$$ is called a **subsequence** *of the sequence* $(x_n)$. 

>[!important] Definition
>The space $X$ is said to be **sequentially compact** if *every sequence* of points of $X$ has a **convergent** *subsequence*.
