## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Linear Continuum


>[!important] Definition
>A **simply ordered set** $L$ having *more than one element* is called a **linear continuum** if the following hold:
>
>- $L$ has the **least upper bound property**.
>- If $x < y$, there exists $z$ such that $$x < z < y.$$

## Explanation

>[!important] Theorem
>If $L$ is a **linear continuum** in the **order topology**, then $L$ is **connected**, and so are **intervals** and **rays** in $L$.
