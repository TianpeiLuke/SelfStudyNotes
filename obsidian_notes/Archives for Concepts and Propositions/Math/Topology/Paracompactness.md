## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Paracompactness

>[!important] Definition
>A collection of subsets $\mathscr{B}$ is a **refinement** of a collection of subsets $\mathscr{A}$ if for every element $B \in \mathscr{B}$,  $B$ is also a subset of some element in $\mathscr{A}$.


>[!important] Definition
>A space $X$ is **paracompact** if *every open covering* $\mathscr{A}$ of $X$ has a **locally finite open refinement** $\mathscr{B}$ that *covers* $X$.
