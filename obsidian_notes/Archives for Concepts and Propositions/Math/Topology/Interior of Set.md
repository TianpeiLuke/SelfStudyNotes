## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Interior of Set


>[!important] Definition
>Given a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$,  **the interior of $A$** is defined as *the union* of *all open sets* **contained in $A$**.
>
>The interior of $A$ is denoted by **$\text{int}(A)$** or by **$\mathring{A}$** 

## Explanation

>[!info]
>By definition
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \mathring{A} \subseteq A \subseteq \bar{A}.
> \end{align*}
