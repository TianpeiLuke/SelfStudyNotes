## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Second Countability


>[!important] Definition
>If a space $X$ has *a countable basis* for its *topology*, then $X$ is said to satisfy **the second countability axiom**, or to be **second-countable**.

## Explanation


## Properties

>[!important] Proposition
>Suppose that $X$ has a **countable basis**. 
>
>Then
> - Every **open covering** of $X$ contains a **countable** *subcollection* covering $X$. ($X$ is **Lindelöf space**.)
>- There exists a **countable subset** of $X$ that is **dense** in $X$. ($X$ is **separable**)

>[!important] Proposition
>Suppose that $X$ is a **metrizable space**. The following statements are **equivalent**: 
> 
>- $X$ has a **countable basis** (**second-countable**).
>- $X$ has a **countable dense subset** (**separable**).
>- Every **open covering** of $X$ contains a **countable** *subcollection* covering $X$. (**Lindelöf space**).
