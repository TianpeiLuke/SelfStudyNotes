## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Directed System of Index Set

>[!important] Definition
>A **directed system** is *an index set* $I$ together with an **ordering** $\prec$ which satisfies:
>
> 
>- If $\alpha, \beta \in l$ then there *exists* $\gamma \in I$ so that $$\gamma \succ \alpha \quad \text{ and } \quad \gamma \succ \beta.$$
>- $\prec$  is a **partial ordering**.
