## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Whitney Embedding Theorem

>[!info]
>Our first application of [[Sard Theorem]] is to show that **every smooth manifold can be embedded into a Euclidean space**. 
>
>In fact, we will show that every smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary is **diffeomorphic** to a properly **embedded submanifold** (with or without boundary) of $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$.


>[!important] Whitney Embedding Theorem
>Every **smooth $n$-manifold** with or without boundary admits a proper **smooth embedding** into **$\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$**.

>[!important] Strong Whitney Embedding Theorem
>If $n > 0$, every **smooth $n$-manifold** admits a **smooth embedding** into **$\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.**
