## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Whitney Approximation Theorem for Functions

>[!info]
>We begin with a theorem about **smoothly approximating functions** into Euclidean spaces. 
>
>Our first theorem shows, in particular, that **any continuous function** from *a smooth manifold* $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$ can be **uniformly approximated** by a **smooth function**.


>[!important] Whitney Approximation Theorem for Functions
>Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and $$F: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$$ is a **continuous** function. 
>
>Given any **positive continuous** function $\delta: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, there *exists* a **smooth function** $$\widetilde{F}: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$$ that is **$\delta$-close** to $F$. 
>
>If $F$ is **smooth** on a **closed** *subset* $A \subseteq M$, then $\widetilde{F}$ can be chosen to be **equal to** $F$ on $A$.
