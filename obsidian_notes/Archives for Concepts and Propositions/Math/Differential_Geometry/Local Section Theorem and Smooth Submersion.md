## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: The Local Section Theorem


>[!important] Local Section Theorem
>Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds and $\pi: M \rightarrow N$ is a smooth map. 
>
>Then $\pi$ is a **smooth submersion** *if and only if* **every point** of $M$ is in the **image** of a **smooth local section** of $\pi$.
