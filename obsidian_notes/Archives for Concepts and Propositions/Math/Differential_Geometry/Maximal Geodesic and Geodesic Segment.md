## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Maximal Geodesic and Geodesic Segment

![[Covariant Derivative Along a Curve#^3107a5]]

![[Geodesic on Manifolds#^1d16a0]]

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a *smooth manifold* and $\nabla$ a *connection* in $T\mathcal{M}$.
>
>A *geodesic* $\gamma: I \to \mathcal{M}$ is said to be **maximal** if it cannot be *extended* to a *geodesic* on a *larger interval*.
>
>That is, there *does not exists* a geodesic $\tilde{\gamma}: \tilde{I} \to \mathcal{M}$ 
>- on interval $\tilde{I} \supset I$ properly containing $I$  
>- and satisfying $$\tilde{\gamma}|_{I} = \gamma.$$
