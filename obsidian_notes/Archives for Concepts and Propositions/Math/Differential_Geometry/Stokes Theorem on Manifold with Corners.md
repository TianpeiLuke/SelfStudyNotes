## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Stokes's Theorem

>[!important] Stokes' Theorem
>Let $\omega$ be a **smooth $(n-1)$-form** with **compact support** on an **oriented**, $n$-dimensional manifold with boundary $M$, where $\partial M$ is given the **induced orientation**.
>
>Then
>$$
>\begin{align*}
>\int_{\partial M} \omega = \int_{M} d\omega
\end{align*}
>$$
>where $d\omega$ is the **exterior derivative** of $\omega.$
