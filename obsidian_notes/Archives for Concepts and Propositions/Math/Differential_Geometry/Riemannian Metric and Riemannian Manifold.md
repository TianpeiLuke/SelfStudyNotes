## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Riemannian Metric and *Riemannian Manifold*

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a *smooth manifold* with or without boundary. 
>
>A **Riemannian metric** on $\mathcal{M}$ is a *smooth* **symmetric covariant** $2$-tensor field on $\mathcal{M}$ that is *positive definite* at each point.

>[!important] Definition
>We can also define the Riemannian metric $g \in \Sigma^{2}(T^{*}\mathcal{M})$ *pointwisely*. 
>
>For each $p \in \mathcal{M}$,  *the Riemannian metric evaluated at $p$* is the **inner product** on $T_{p}\mathcal{M} \times T_{p}\mathcal{M}$, i.e.
>$$
>g_{p}(v, w) := \left\langle v ,  w\right\rangle_{g}, \;\; v, w \in T_{p}\mathcal{M}.
>$$

>[!important] Definition
>A **Riemannian manifold** is a pair $(\mathcal{M}, g)$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth manifold and $g$ is a *Riemannian metric* on $\mathcal{M}$. 
>
>One sometimes simply says *"$\mathcal{M}$ is a Riemannian manifold"* if $\mathcal{M}$ is understood to be endowed with *a specific Riemannian metric*. 
>
>A Riemannian manifold *with boundary* is defined similarly.


## Explanation

>[!info]
>**Riemannian manifold** defines inner product in its tangent space. which can be seen as a *finite-dimensional* **nonlinear Hilbert space**.
