## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Space of all Smooth Covector Fields on a Manifold

>[!important] Definition
>We denote **the real vector space** of **all smooth covector fields** on $M$ by **$\mathfrak{X}^{*}(M)$** (or $\Gamma(T^{*}M)$). 

>[!important]
>As smooth sections of a vector bundle, elements of $\mathfrak{X}^{*}(M)$ can be **multiplied** by *smooth real-valued functions*: if $f \in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M)$ and $\omega \in \mathfrak{X}^{*}(M)$, the *covector field* $f\omega$ is defined by
>$$
> \begin{align}
> (f\omega)_p &= f(p)\,\omega_{p}. 
> \end{align}
>$$  

>[!info]
>Because it is *the space of smooth sections* of a *vector bundle*, $\mathfrak{X}^{*}(M)$ is a **module** over  $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M)$.
