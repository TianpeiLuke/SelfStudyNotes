## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Parameterized Curve on Manifold

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a *smooth manifold* with or without boundary.
>
>Define a **curve** *in* $\mathcal{M}$ to be a *continuous map* $\gamma: J \to \mathcal{M}$ where $J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an interval.

### Coordinate Representation

>[!important]
>Let $(U, \varphi)$ be a *smooth chart* with *coordinate functions* $(x^i)$. 
>
>If $\gamma(t_{0})\in U$, we can write the *coordinate representation of* $\gamma$ as $$\gamma(t) := \left(\gamma^1(t) \,{,}\ldots{,}\, \gamma^n(t)\right)$$ for $t$ sufficiently close to $t_{0}$.
