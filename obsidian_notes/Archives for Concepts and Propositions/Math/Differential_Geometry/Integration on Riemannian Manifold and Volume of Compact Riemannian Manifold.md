## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Integration on Riemannian Manifold and Volume of Compact Riemannian Manifold

![[Riemannian Volume Form#^e3acc5]]


>[!important] Definition
>Let $(\mathcal{M}. g)$ be an *oriented Riemannian $n$- manifold* with or without boundary.
>
>Let $f: U \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function on $\mathcal{M}$ where $U \subset \mathcal{M}$ is a *pre-compact open subset*. That is $f$ is a smooth function on $\mathcal{M}$ with *compact support.*
>
>Then the **integration** of $f$ *over* $\mathcal{M}$ is defined as 
>$$
>\int_{\mathcal{M}} f\,dV_{g} 
>$$
>- If $\mathcal{M}$ is *compact*, then the **volume** of $\mathcal{M}$ is defined to be $$\text{Vol}(\mathcal{M}) := \int_{\mathcal{M}}dV_{g} = \int_{\mathcal{M}}\mathbb{1}\,dV_{g}.$$
