## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Symmetric Connection

>[!important] Definition
>A *connection* $\nabla$ on the *tangent bundle* of a *smooth manifold* $M$ is **symmetric** if for any $X,Y \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$, the following equation holds
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \nabla_{X}Y - \nabla_{Y}X  &= [X, Y],
> \end{align*}
>$$  
>where $[X, Y]$ is the *Lie bracket* of two vector fields.
