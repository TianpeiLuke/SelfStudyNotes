>[!important] Definition
>Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary. 
>
>By the definition we just gave, a *connection in $TM$* is a map

> \begin{align*}
> \nabla: \mathfrak{X}(M) \times \mathfrak{X}(M) \rightarrow \mathfrak{X}(M),

> satisfying properties (1)-(3) above. 
> 
>**A connection in the tangent bundle $TM$** is often called simply **a connection on $M$**. 
>
>The terms **affine connection** and **linear connection** are also sometimes used in this context.
