## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Sard's Theorem

>[!important] Sard's Theorem
>Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary and $F: M \rightarrow N$ is a **smooth map**. 
>
>Then the *set of* **critical values** *of* $F$ has **measure zero in $N$**.

>[!important] Corollary
>Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, and $F: M \rightarrow N$ is a **smooth map**. 
>
>If $\text{dim}\,M < \text{dim}\,N$ , then $F(M)$ has **measure zero in $N$**.

>[!info]
>It is important to be aware tha Corollary above is **false** if $F$ is *merely assumed to be continuous*. 
>
>For example, there is a continuous map $F: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ whose image is the entire unit square $[0,1] \times [0, 1]$. (Such a map is called a **space-filling curve**).

>[!info]
>If $F$ is a smooth immersion, then $F(M)$ has *lower dimension* in the ambient space of $N$


>[!important] Corollary
>Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and $S \subseteq M$ is an **immersed submanifold** with or without boundary. 
>
>If $\text{dim}\,S < \text{dim}\,M$,  then $S$ has **measure zero** in $M$.
