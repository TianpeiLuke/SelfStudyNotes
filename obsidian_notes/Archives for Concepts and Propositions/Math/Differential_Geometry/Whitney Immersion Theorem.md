## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Whitney Immersion Theorem

>[!info]
>Our first application of [[Sard Theorem]] is to show that **every smooth manifold can be embedded into a Euclidean space**. 


>[!important] Whitney Embedding Theorem
>Every **smooth $n$-manifold** with or without boundary admits a **smooth immersion** into **$\mathbb{R}^{2n}$**.

>[!important] Strong Whitney Immersion Theorem
>If $n > 1$, every **smooth $n$-manifold** admits a **smooth immersion** into **$\mathbb{R}^{2n-1}$**.
