## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Levi Civita Connection

![[Connection in Vector Bundle and Covariant Derivative#^94b423]]

- [[Connection in Vector Bundle and Covariant Derivative]]

>[!important] Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry
>Let $(M, g)$ be a **Riemannian** or **pseudo-Riemannian manifold** (with or without boundary). 
>
>There **exists** a **unique connection** $\nabla$ on $TM$ $$\nabla: \mathfrak{X}(M) \times \mathfrak{X}(M) \to \mathfrak{X}(M)$$ that 
>- is **compatible with** $g$ 
>- and **symmetric**. 
>  
>It is called the **Levi-Civita connection** of $g$ (or also, when $g$ is **positive definite**, the **Riemannian connection**.
