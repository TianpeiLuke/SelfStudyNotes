## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Smooth Manifold

>[!important] Definition
>If $M$ is a topological manifold, a **smooth structure** on $M$ is a *maximal smooth atlas*. 

>[!important] Definition
>A **smooth manifold** is a pair $(M, \mathcal{A})$, where $M$ is a *topological manifold* and $\mathcal{A}$ is a *smooth structure* on $M$.

## Explanation


>[!info]
>When *the smooth structure* is understood, we usually *omit* mention of it and just say "*$M$ is a smooth manifold.*" 

>[!info]
>Smooth structures are also called **differentiable structures** or **$\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ structures** by some authors. We also use the term **smooth manifold structure** to mean a *manifold topology* together with a *smooth structure*.


>[!info]
>- In fact, a given topological manifold may have *many different smooth structures*. 
>
>- On the other hand, it is *not always possible to find a smooth structure* on a given topological manifold: there exist *topological manifolds* that **admit no smooth structures** at all.
