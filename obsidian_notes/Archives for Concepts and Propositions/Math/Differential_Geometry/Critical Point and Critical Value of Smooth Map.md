## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Critical Value of Smooth Map

>[!important] Defintion
>If $\Phi: M \to N$ is a smooth map, a point $p \in M$ is said to be a **critical point** of $\Phi$ if 
>$$
>d\Phi_{p}: T_{p}M \to T_{\Phi(p)}N
>$$
>is **not surjective**.

>[!info]
>If
>$$
>\text{dim }M < \text{dim }N,
>$$
>then *every point in $M$ is critical point*.

>[!important] Definition
>A point $c\in N$ is said to be a **critical value** of $\Phi$ if every point of *the level set*
>$$
>\Phi^{-1}(c)
>$$
>is a *critical point*.
