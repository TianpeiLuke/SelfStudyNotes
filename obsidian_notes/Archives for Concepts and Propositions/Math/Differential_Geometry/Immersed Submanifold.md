## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Immersed Submanifold

>[!important] Definition
>Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. 
>
>An **immersed submanifold** of $M$ is a subset $S \subseteq M$ endowed with a *topology* (**not necessarily the subspace topology**) with respect to which it is *a topological manifold* (without boundary), and a *smooth structure* with respect to which the *inclusion map* $$S \xhookrightarrow{} M$$ is a *smooth immersion*.

>[!info]
>$S \subset M$ is an embedded smooth submanifold
>- $S$ is a **topological manifold** (may not need to be subspace topology)
>- $S$ has *smooth structure*
>- The inclusion map $S \xhookrightarrow{} M$ is a **smooth immersion**

>[!important] Definition
>If $S$ is an *immersed submanifold* of $M$, the *difference* $$\text{dim }M - \text{dim }S$$ is called **the codimension of $S$ in $M$**.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>This terms can be generalized to the **immersed topological submanifold** of $M$ to be a subset $S \subseteq M$ endowed with a *topology* such that it is a *topological manifold* and such that the **inclusion map** is a **topological immersion**. 
>
>It is an *embedded topological submanifold* if the inclusion is a **topological embedding**.
