## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Pullback of Covector Fields


>[!important] Definition
>If $F: M \rightarrow N$ is a smooth map and $\omega$ is a *differential form* on $N$, the **pullback** $F^{*}$ is a *differential form* on $M$; defined as for *any covariant tensor field*:
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> (F^{*}\omega)_p(v_1, \ldots, v_k) &= \omega_p\left(dF_p(v_1), \ldots, dF_p(v_k)\right).
> \end{align*}
>$$

## Explanation

>[!info]
> For $1$-form, we can recover the formula for the [[Pullback of Covector Fields]] and [[Adjoint of Bounded Operator in Banach Space]] of $dF_{p}$
> 
> This definition is a **generalization** of the [[Adjoint of Bounded Operator in Banach Space]] to **tensor space**.
