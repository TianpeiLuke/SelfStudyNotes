>**Name**: Sharp and Raise Index of Covector Field

![[Bundle Homomorphism#^d28d96]]

- [[Bundle Homomorphism]]

>[!important] Definition
>Given $$\omega = \omega_j\,\epsilon^{j},$$ the *inverse map* $\widehat{g}^{-1}: T^{*}M \to TM$ is given by
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \widehat{g}^{-1}(\omega) &= \omega^i\,E_i
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
> where the result is
>$$ 
> \begin{align}
> \omega^{i} &= g^{i,j}\,\omega_{j}
> \end{align}
>$$  
>
>If $\omega$ is a *covector field*, the *vector field* $\widehat{g}^{-1}(\omega)$ is called **$\omega$ sharp** and denoted by $\omega^{\sharp}$.
>
 >We say that the **vector field** $\omega^{\sharp}$  is obtained from **covector field** $\omega$ by **raising an index**.
