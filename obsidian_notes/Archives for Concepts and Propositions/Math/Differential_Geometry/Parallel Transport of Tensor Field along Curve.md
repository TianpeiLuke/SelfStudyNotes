## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Parallel Transport of Tensor Field along Curve

![[Covariant Derivative Along a Curve#^3107a5]]

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a *smooth manifold* and let $\nabla$ be a *connection* in $T\mathcal{M}$. 
>
>A *smooth vector* or *tensor field* $V$ *along a smooth curve* $\gamma$ is said to be **parallel along** $\gamma$ *with respect to* $\nabla$ if $$D_t(V) = 0.$$

## Explanation

>[!important]
>It is always possible to **extend** a *vector at a point* to a **parallel vector field** *along any given curve*. 
>
>However, it may not be possible in general to extend it to a **parallel vector field** on an **open subset** of the *manifold*. 
>- The impossibility of finding such extensions is intimately connected with the phenomenon of **curvature**.
