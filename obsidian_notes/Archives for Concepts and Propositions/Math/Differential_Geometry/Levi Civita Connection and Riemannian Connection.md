## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Levi Civita Connection and Riemannian Connection

>[!important] Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry
>Let $(M, g)$ be a *Riemannian* or *pseudo-Riemannian manifold* (with or without boundary). 
>
>A *connection* $\nabla$ on $TM$ $$\nabla: \mathfrak{X}(M) \times \mathfrak{X}(M) \to \mathfrak{X}(M)$$ is called the **Levi-Civita connection** of $g$, if for any $X, Y, Z\in \mathfrak{X}(M)$, 
>- $\nabla$ is **compatible with** $g$, i.e. $$Z\left\langle  X\,,\, Y   \right\rangle_{g} = \left\langle \nabla_{Z}X\,,\, Y \right\rangle_{g} + \left\langle  X\,,\,  \nabla_{Z}Y \right\rangle_{g}$$
>- and **symmetric**, i.e. $$\nabla_{X}Y - \nabla_{Y}X  = [X, Y],$$ where $[X,Y]$ is the *Lie bracket*.
>  
>When $g$ is *positive definite*, the **Riemannian connection**.
