## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Measurable Function


>[!important] Definition
>Let $(X, \mathscr{B})$ be a *measurable space*, and let $f : X \rightarrow [0, +\infty]$ or $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be an *unsigned* or *complex-valued* function. 
>
>We say that $f$ is **measurable** if $f^{-1}(U)$ is **$\mathscr{B}$-measurable** for every *open subset* $U$ of $[0, +\infty]$ or $\mathbb{C}$.
