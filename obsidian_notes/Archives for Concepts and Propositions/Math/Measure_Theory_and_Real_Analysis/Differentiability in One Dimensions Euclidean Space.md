## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Differentiability in One Dimensions Euclidean Space

>[!important] Definition
>Let $U \subset \mathbb{R}$ be an open subset.
>
>A function $f: U \to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be **differentiable** *at* $x_{0}\in U$ if the *limit exists*
>$$
>f'(x_{0}) = \frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{x_{0}} f(x) = \lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(x_{0} + h) - f(x_{0})}{h}
>$$
>- The limit $f'$ is called the **derivative** of $f$.
