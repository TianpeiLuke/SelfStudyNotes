## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Product Measure on Infinite Product Space

>[!important] Theorem
>Let $T$ be an **arbitrary set**. For each $t \in T$, let $(\mathcal{X}_{t}, \mathscr{B}_{t}, \mu_{t})$ be a **probability space** in which 
>- $\mathcal{X}_{t}$ is a **locally compact**, **$\sigma$-compact metric space**, with 
>- $\mathscr{B}_{t}$ being its *Borel $\sigma$-algebra* (i.e. the $\sigma$-algebra *generated by the open sets*). 
>  
>Then there exists a **unique probability measure** $$\mu_{T} = \prod_{t\in T} \mu_{t}$$ on $$(\mathcal{X}_{T}, \mathscr{B}_{T}) := \left(\prod_{t\in T}\mathcal{X}_{t}\,,\, \prod_{t\in T}\mathscr{B}_{t} \right)$$ with the **property** that $$\mu_{T}\left(\prod_{t\in T}E_{t}\right) = \prod_{t\in T}\mu_{t}(E_{t})$$ whenever $E_{t} \in \mathscr{B}_{t}$ for *each* $t\in T$, and one has $E_{t} = \mathcal{X}_{t}$ for **all but finitely** *many of the* $t$.
