## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Absolutely Continuous)

>[!important] The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Absolutely Continuous)
>
>Let $F: [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be **absolutely continuous**. 
>
>Then
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \int_{[a, b]}F'(x) dx = F(b) - F(a).
> \end{align*}
>$$  


- [[Absolutely Continuous Function]]


## Explanation

>[!info]
>Note that the absolutely continuous function is **of bounded variation** so $F'$ *exists almost everywhere*. 


>[!info]
>**The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** under Lebesgue theory can be found
