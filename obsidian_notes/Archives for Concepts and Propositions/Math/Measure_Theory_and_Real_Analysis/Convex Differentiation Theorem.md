## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Convex Differentiation Theorem

>[!important] Convex Differentiation Theorem (Alexandrov theorem)
>If $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is open, and $f: U\to \mathbb{R}^m$ is **convex**, then it is 
>- **continuous** and 
>- **almost everywhere differentiable**, and 
>- its **derivative** $f'$ is **almost everywhere differentiable**.
