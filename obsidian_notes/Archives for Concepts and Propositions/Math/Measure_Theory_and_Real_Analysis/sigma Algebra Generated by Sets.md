## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  $\sigma$-Algebra Generated by Sets

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a collection of sets. **The $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathscr{F}$**, denoted as $\sigma(\mathscr{F}) := \langle \mathscr{F} \rangle$, is the **_intersection_** of *__all__ the $\sigma$-algebras* that *contain* $\mathscr{F}$.  
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \sigma(\mathscr{F}) = \langle \mathscr{F} \rangle = \bigwedge_{\mathscr{B}_{\alpha} \supseteq \mathscr{F}}\mathscr{B}_{\alpha}.
> \end{align*}
>$$

## Explanation

>[!important]
>$\sigma(\mathscr{F})$ is the **coarsest** $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathscr{F}$.

## Existence


![[sigma Algebra#^78dd44]]


>[!important] Proposition
>Given a collection $\mathscr{C}$ of subsets of $\mathcal{X}$, there exists a **unique minimal $\sigma$-algebra** containing $\mathscr{C}$.

## Recursive Description

>[!info]
>The following procedure describes the **recursive description** of a generated  $\sigma$-algebra

>[!important] 
>$\sigma(\mathscr{F})$ is **generated** according to the following procedure: 
> 
>  1. *For every set* $A \in \mathscr{F}$, $A\in \sigma(\mathscr{F})$; also put the full *collection* $\mathscr{F} \subset \sigma(\mathscr{F})$;
> 2. Take the **finite union** and **finite intersection** of any *subcollections*; i.e. for $\set{A_{k}}\subset \mathscr{F}$, put $$\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}A_{k} \in \sigma(\mathscr{F}), n\ge 1$$ and  $$\bigcap_{k=1}^{n}A_{k} \in \sigma(\mathscr{F}), n\ge 1;$$
> 3. Put the **countably infinite union** and **intersections** of any *subcollections*; i.e. $\set{A_{k}}\subset \mathscr{F}$, put $$\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}A_{k} \in \sigma(\mathscr{F})$$ and  $$\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty}A_{k} \in \sigma(\mathscr{F});$$
> 4. Put the **complements** $A^{c} \in \sigma(\mathscr{F}), \forall A\in \sigma(\mathscr{F})$;
