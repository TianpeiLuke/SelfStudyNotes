## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Monotone Convergence Theorem


>[!important] Theorem
>Let $(X, \mathscr{B}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $0 \le f_1 \le  f_2 \le \ldots$ be a **monotone non-decreasing** sequence of **unsigned** *measurable functions* on $X.$ Then we have
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int_{X}f_{n} d\mu &= \int_{X} \left( \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty} f_{n} \right) d\mu 
> \end{align*}
> $$
