## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Space of Continuous Differentiable Functions

>[!important] Definition
>A function is said to be **continuously differentiable** if its *derivative* is also a *continuous* function.

>[!important] Definition
>The **space** of **continuous differentiable functions** is denoted as $$\mathcal{C}^{1}(U, \mathbb{R}) := \left\{ f: U \to \mathbb{R} \;|\; f' \text{ is continuous} \right\} $$
>
>The **space** of **continuous $k$-th differentiable functions** is denoted as $$\mathcal{C}^{k}(U, \mathbb{R}) := \left\{ f: U \to \mathbb{R} \;|\; f^{(s)} \text{ are all continuous, }\, s\le k \right\} $$
>- The function $f$ of $m$-th order *continuous derivatives* $f^{(m)}$ for $m\le k$.
>
>The **space** of **smooth functions** is denoted as $$\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(U, \mathbb{R}) := \left\{ f: U \to \mathbb{R} \;|\; f^{(s)} \text{ is continuous, }\, s\le \infty \right\} $$
>- The function $f$ has *continuous derivatives* for **all orders**.
>  
>The *space of continuous functions* is denoted as $\mathcal{C}^{0}(U, \mathbb{R})$.
