## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Signed Measure defined via Integral


>[!important] Definition
>For a *signed measure*  $\nu$ defined via $$\nu(E) = \int_{E}f d\mu$$ for all $E \in \mathscr{B}$, we use the notation to express the *relationship*
>$$
>\begin{align*}
> d\nu &= f\, d\mu.
>\end{align*}

>[!info]
>Sometimes, by a slight abuse of language, we shall refer to *"the signed measure $f\, d\mu.$"*
