## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Boolean Algebra Generated by Functions

>[!important] Definition
>Given a collection of sets $\mathscr{F}$, then $\langle \mathscr{F} \rangle_{bool}$ is **the Boolean algebra generated by $\mathscr{F}$**, if it is the **_intersection_** of *__all__ the Boolean algebras* that *contain* $\mathscr{F}$. 
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \langle \mathscr{F} \rangle_{bool} = \bigwedge_{\mathscr{B}_{\alpha} \supseteq \mathscr{F}}\mathscr{B}_{\alpha}.
> \end{align*}
>$$  

- [[Boolean Algebra]]

## Explanation

>[!important] Proposition
>We have the following results regarding $\langle \mathscr{F} \rangle_{bool}$
> 
> - $\langle \mathscr{F} \rangle_{bool}$ is the **coarest** *Boolean algebra* that contains $\mathscr{F}$.
>   $$
>   \forall \text{ boolean alegra } \mathscr{G} \supset \mathscr{F} \implies \mathscr{G} \supset \langle \mathscr{F} \rangle_{bool}
>   $$
> - Note that $\mathscr{F}$ is a *Boolean algebra* **if and only if** $\mathscr{F} = \langle \mathscr{F} \rangle_{bool}$.
> - If $\mathscr{F}$ is collection of $n$ **sets**, then $\langle \mathscr{F} \rangle_{bool}$ is a **finite** *Boolean algebra* with cardinality $2^{2^{n}}$.

>[!info]
>The definition of a Boolean algebra generated by a collection of sets shares a lot of similarities with the definition of *weak topology generated by functions*. 
>
>Weak topology generated by a set of functions $\mathcal{F}$ is the coarest topology that makes all functions in $\mathcal{F}$ continuous.
