## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: The Hahn Decomposition Theorem


>[!important] Theorem
>If $\nu$ is a *signed measure* on $(X,\mathscr{B})$, there exists a **positive set** $P$ and a **negative set** $N$ for $\nu$ such that $$P\cup N= X \text{ and } P\cap N=\emptyset.$$
>
>If $P', N'$ is *another* such pair, then $P\Delta P'= N\Delta N'$ is **null** *w.r.t.* $\nu$.

>[!important] Definition
>The *decomposition* of $X = P\cup N$ as $X$ is a *disjoint union* of a *positive set* and a *negative set* is called a **Hahn decomposition** for $\nu$.
