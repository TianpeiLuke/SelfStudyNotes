## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Almost Uniform Convergence


>[!important] Definition
>We say that $f_n$ *converges* to $f$ **almost uniformly** if, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an *exceptional set* $E \in \mathscr{B}$ of *measure* $\mu(E) \leq \epsilon$ such that $f_n$ *converges uniformly* to $f$ on the **complement of $E$**.
>
>That is, for arbitrary $\delta$ there exists some $E$ **with $\mu(E) \le \delta$** such that $f_n \rightarrow f$ **uniformly** in $x \in X \setminus E$.
