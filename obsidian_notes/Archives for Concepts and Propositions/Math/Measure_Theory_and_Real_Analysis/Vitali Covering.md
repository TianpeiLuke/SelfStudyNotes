## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Vitali Covering

>[!important] Definition
>A collection $\mathscr{B}$ of *balls* $\set{B}$ is said to be a **Vitali covering** *of a set* $E$, (*covers* $E$ in **Vitali sense**,) if for every $x\in E$,  any $\eta > 0$, there is a *ball* $B\in \mathcal{B}$, such that $x\in B$ and $$m(B)<\eta.$$ 
>
>Thus **every point** is covered by **balls** of **arbitrary small measure**.
