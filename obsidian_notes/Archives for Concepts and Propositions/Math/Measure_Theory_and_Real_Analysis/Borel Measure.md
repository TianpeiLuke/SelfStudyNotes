## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Borel Measure $\mu$ 


>[!important] Definition
>Let $(X, \mathscr{B})$ be a *measurable space*, where $\mathscr{B}$ is a *Borel $\sigma$-algebra.* The **Borel measure** $\mu$ is a non-negative map $\mu: \mathscr{B} \rightarrow [0, +\infty]$ that obeys the following axioms:
> 
> 1. **Empty set**: $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$.
> 2. **Countable additivity**: Whenever $E_1, E_2, \ldots \in \mathscr{B}$ are a *countable sequence* of *disjoint* *Borel sets*, then 
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n\right) &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_n).
> \end{align*}
> $$

## Explanation

>[!info]
>Recall that Borel $\sigma$-algebra is defined as *the $\sigma$-algebra generated by all open/closed subsets in $\mathcal{X}$.*  

>[!info]
>Recall that Borel $\sigma$-algebra requires $\mathcal{X}$ to be a topological space.

>[!info]
>On the other hand, by **complement** property and **countable additivity** property of (Borel) $\sigma$-algebra ,  $G_{\delta}$ set and $F_{\sigma}$ set are **both Borel sets**
>- $F_{\sigma} \in \mathcal{B}$ since it is countable union of a Borel set (closed set)
>- $G_{\delta} \in \mathcal{B}$ since it is complement of a $F_{\sigma}$ set

## Borel Measure on Euclidean Space


>[!important]
>The **Lebesgue measure space** $(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathcal{L}[\mathbb{R}^d], m)$ is **complete**, but the **Borel measure space** $(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathcal{B}[\mathbb{R}^d], \mu)$ is **not**.
