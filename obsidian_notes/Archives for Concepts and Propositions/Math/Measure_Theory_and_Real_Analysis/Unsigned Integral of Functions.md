## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Unsigned Integral of Functions

>[!important] Definition
>Let $(X, \mathscr{B}, \mu)$ be a *measure space*, and let $f : X\rightarrow  [0,+\infty]$ be *(unsigned) measurable*. 
>
>Then we define the **unsigned integral** of $f$ by the formula
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \int_{X}f d\mu &:= \sup \left\{\text{simp}\int_{X}g d\mu: g \text{ is a simple such that } 0\le g\le f  \right\} 
> \end{align*}
>$$
