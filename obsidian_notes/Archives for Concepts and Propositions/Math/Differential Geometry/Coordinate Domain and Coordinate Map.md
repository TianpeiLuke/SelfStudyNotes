## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: *Coordinate Domain* and *Coordinate Map*

>[!important] Definition
>Given a chart $(U, \varphi)$, we call the set $U$ a **coordinate domain**, or a **coordinate neighborhood** of each of its points. 
>
>- If, in addition, $\varphi(U)$ is an *open ball* in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $U$ is called a **coordinate ball**; if $\varphi(U)$ is an *open cube*, $U$ is a **coordinate cube**. 
>
>- The map $\varphi$ is called a **(local) coordinate map**, and the **component functions** $(x^1,\ldots, x^n)$ of $\varphi$, defined by $\varphi(p) = (x^1(p), \ldots, x^n(p))$, are called **local coordinates** on $U$.
