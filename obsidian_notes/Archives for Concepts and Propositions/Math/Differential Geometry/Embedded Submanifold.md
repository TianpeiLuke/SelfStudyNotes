## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Embedded Submanifold

>[!important] Definition
>Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary. 
>
>An **embedded submanifold** of $M$ is a subset $S \subseteq M$ that is a *manifold* (without boundary) in the *subspace topology*, endowed with a *smooth structure* with respect to which the *inclusion map* $$\iota: S \xhookrightarrow{} M$$ is a *smooth embedding*.

>[!info]
>$S \subset M$ is an **embedded smooth submanifold** if
>- $S$ is a **topological manifold** under **subspace topology**
>- $S$ has *smooth structure*
>- The inclusion map $S \xhookrightarrow{} M$ is a **smooth embedding**

>[!important] Definition
 >Embedded submanifolds are also called **regular submanifolds**.


>[!important] Definition
>If $S$ is an *embedded submanifold* of $M$, the *difference* $$\text{dim }M - \text{dim }S$$ is called **the codimension of $S$ in $M$**.

>[!important] Definition
 >The containing manifold $M$ is called the **ambient manifold** for $S$. 

>[!important] Definition
>An **embedded hypersurface** is an embedded submanifold of **codimension $1$.** 

>[!info]
>The **empty set** is an embedded submanifold of **any dimension**.
