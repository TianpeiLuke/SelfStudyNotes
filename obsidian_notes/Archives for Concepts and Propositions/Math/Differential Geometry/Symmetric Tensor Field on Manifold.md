## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Symmetric Tensor Field on Manifold

>[!important] Definition
>A **symmetric tensor field** on a manifold (with or without boundary) is simply a *covariant tensor field* whose value at each point is a *symmetric tensor*.

>[!important] Definition
>The **symmetric product** of two or more *tensor fields* is defined *pointwise*, just like the tensor product. 

>[!info]
>Thus, for example, if $A$ and $B$ are *smooth covector fields*, their symmetric product is **the smooth $2$-tensor field $AB$**, which is given by

> \begin{align*}
> AB &= \frac{1}{2}\left( A \otimes B \right) + \frac{1}{2}\left( B \otimes A \right).
