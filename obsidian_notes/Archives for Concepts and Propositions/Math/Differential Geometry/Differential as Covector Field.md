## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Differential as Covector Field

>[!important] Definition
>Let $f$ be a *smooth real-valued function* on a *smooth manifold* $M$ with or without boundary. (As usual, all of this discussion applies to functions defined on an open subset $U \subseteq M$; simply by *replacing* $M$ with $U$ throughout.) 
>
>We define a **covector field** $df$ , called **the differential of $f$**, by
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> df_{p}(v) &= v\,f, \quad \forall v\in T_{p}M.
> \end{align*}
>$$

## Explanation

>[!info]
>Just as the vector fields as *derivation of smooth map* without fixing the point, the differential of $f$ is a **generalization** of the *differential of smooth map* by dropping the point.
