## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Diffeomorphism

>[!important] Definition on Euclidean spaces
>If $U$ and $V$ are *open* subsets of Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$, respectively, a function $F: U \rightarrow V$ is said to be a **diffeomorphism** if $F$ is *smooth*,  *bijective* and has a *smooth inverse map*.

>[!info]
>A *diffeomorphism* is, in particular, a **homeomorphism**.

>[!important] Definition on Smooth Manifolds
>If $M$ and $N$ are *smooth manifolds* with or without boundary, a **diffeomorphism** from $M$ to $N$ is a *smooth bijective map* $F: M \rightarrow N$ that has a *smooth inverse*. 
>
>We say that $M$ and $N$ are **diffeomorphic** if there exists a *diffeomorphism* between them. Sometimes this is symbolized by $M \approx N$.

## Explanation

>$$
>F \text{ diffeomorphism} \implies F^{-1} \text{ exists and smooth} \implies dF_{p} \text{ bijective for every }p
