## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Space of all Smooth Sections of Vector Bundle

>[!important] Definition
>If $E \rightarrow M$ is a smooth vector bundle, the *set of* **all smooth global sections of $E$** is a **vector space** under *pointwise addition* and *scalar multiplication*:
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> (c_1 \sigma_1 + c_2 \sigma_2)(p) &= c_1 \sigma_1(p) + c_2 \sigma_2(p)
> \end{align*}
>$$  
>
>This vector space is usually denoted by **$\Gamma(E)$**.

>[!info]
>Note that 
>- for vector fields of tangent bundle $TM$, we use $\mathfrak{X}(M)$. We can also use $\Gamma(TM)$.
>- for covector fieilds of cotangent bundle $T^{*}M$, we use $\mathfrak{X}^{*}(M)$. We can also use $\Gamma(T^{*}M)$.
