## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Smooth Bundle and Trivial Bundle

- [[Vector Bundle]]

>[!important] Definition
>If there exists a *local trivialization* of $E$ over **all** of $M$ (called a **global trivialization** of $E$), then $E$ is said to be a **trivial bundle**. 
>
>In this case, $E$ itself is **homeomorphic** to the **product space** $M \times \mathbb{R}^k$. 



>[!important] Definition
>If $E \rightarrow M$ is a *smooth bundle* that admits a **smooth global trivialization**, then we say that $E$ is **smoothly trivial**. 
>
>In this case $E$ is **diffeomorphic** to $M \times \mathbb{R}^k$, not just *homeomorphic*.
