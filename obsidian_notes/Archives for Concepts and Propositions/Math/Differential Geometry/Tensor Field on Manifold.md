## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Tensor Field on Manifold

>[!important] Definition
>A *section* of a *tensor bundle* is called a **(covariant, contravariant, or mixed) tensor field** on $M$*. 

- [[Section of Vector Bundle]]

- [[Vector Bundle of Contravariant k-Tensor]]
- [[Vector Bundle of Covariant k-Tensor]]
- [[Vector Bundle of Mixed Tensor of Type]]

>[!important] Definition
>A **smooth tensor field** is a *section* that is *smooth* in the usual sense of smooth sections of vector bundles. 

- [[Smooth Section of Vector Bundle]]


## Explanation

>[!example]
>The **contravariant $1$-tensor fields** are the same as **vector fields**, 

- [[Vector Field on Manifold]]


>[!example]
>The **covariant $1$-tensor fields** are **covector fields**.
