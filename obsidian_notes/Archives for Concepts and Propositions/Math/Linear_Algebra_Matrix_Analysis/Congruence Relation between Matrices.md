## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Congruence Relation between Matrices

>[!important] Definition
>Let $A, B\in M_{n}$. 
>
>If there exists a *nonsingular matrix* $S$ such that 
>- $$B = SAS^{*},$$ then $B$ is said to be **$*$-congruent** or **star-congruent** or **conjunctive** to $A$.
>- $$B = SAS^{T},$$ then $B$ is said to be **congruent** or **tee-congruent** to $A$.
