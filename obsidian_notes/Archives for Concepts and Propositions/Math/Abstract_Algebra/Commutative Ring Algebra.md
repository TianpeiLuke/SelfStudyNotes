>**Name**: Commutative Ring Algebra

>[!important] Definition
>Let $R$ be a *commutative ring* with *identity*. An **$R$-algebra** is 
>- a *ring* $A$ *with identity*, 
>- together with a *ring homomorphism* $f: R \to A$ 
>	- *mapping* $1_{R}$ to $1_{A}$ such that 
>	- *sub-string* $f(R)$ of $A$ is contained in the *center* of $A$.
