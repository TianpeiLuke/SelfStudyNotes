## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Matrix Ring

>[!important] Definition
>Let $R$ be an arbitrary *ring*.
>
>The set of all $n\times n$ *square matrices* with *entries from* $R$ is called a **matrix ring**, denoted as $$M_{n}(R) := \left\{ A = [a_{i,j}] \;|\; a_{i,j} \in R, \, i,j=1\,{,}\ldots{,}\,n \right\} .$$
>
>- $(M_{n}(R), +, \cdot)$ is a *ring with identity* under the *matrix addition* and *matrix multiplication* operation
