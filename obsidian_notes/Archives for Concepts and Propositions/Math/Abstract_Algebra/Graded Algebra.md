## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Graded Algebra

>[!important] Definition
>An algebra $A$ is said to be **graded** if it has a *direct sum decomposition* 
>$$A = \bigoplus_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}A^k$$ 
>such that the *product* satisfies 
>$$(A^k)(A^l) \subseteq A^{k+l}$$ 
>for each $k$ and $l$.

- [[Algebra over Field]]

>[!important] Definition
 >A graded algebra is **anticommutative** if the product satisfies $$ab = (-1)^{kl}ba$$ for $a \in A^k$, $b \in A^l$.  
 

## Explanation


>[!example]
 >So $\Lambda(V^{*})$ is an **anticommutative graded algebra**.
