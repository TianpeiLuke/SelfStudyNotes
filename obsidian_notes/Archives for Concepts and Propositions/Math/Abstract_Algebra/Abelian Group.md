## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Commutative Group or *Abelian Group*

>[!important] Definition
>A *group* is a set $G$ with a *binary operation* $\cdot: G \times G \to G$ is called a **abelian group** if the multiplication operation satisfies an additional property:
>- **Commutativity**: for every $a, b\in G$, 
>$$
>a \cdot b = b \cdot a
