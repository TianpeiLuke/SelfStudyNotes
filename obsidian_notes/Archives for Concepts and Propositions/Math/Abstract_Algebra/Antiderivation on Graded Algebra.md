## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Antiderivation on Graded Algebra

>[!important] Definition
>If $$A =  \oplus_{k} A^k$$ is a *graded algebra*, a *linear map* $T: A \rightarrow A$ is said to be **a map of degree $m$** if $$T(A^k) \subseteq A^{k+m}$$ for each $k$. 

- [[Graded Algebra]]

>[!important] Definition
>It is said to be an **antiderivation** if it satisfies $$T(xy) = (Tx)y + (-1)^k\, x(Ty)$$ whenever $x\in A^k$ and $y \in A^l$.
