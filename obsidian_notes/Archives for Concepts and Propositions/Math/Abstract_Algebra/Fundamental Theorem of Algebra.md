## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Fundamental Theorem of Algebra


>[!important] Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
>Any **polynomial** $p(x)$ with **complex coefficients** and of **degree at least** $1$ has **at least one zero** in $\mathbb{C}$.
>
>That is $$p(x) = (x- z)\,q(x)$$ where $z\in \mathbb{C}$ and $q(x)$ is a polynomial with *complex coefficients*, whose *degree is $1$ smaller* than that of $p$.



>[!important] Corollary
>A **polynomial of degree** $n \ge 1$ with **complex coefficients** has, counting *multiplicities*, **exactly $n$ zeros** among the complex numbers.






## Explanation

>[!info]
>The **fundamental theorem of algebra**, also called **d'Alembert's theorem** or the **d'Alembert–Gauss theorem**, states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with *complex coefficients* has at least one *complex root*. This includes polynomials with real coefficients, since every real number is a complex number with its imaginary part equal to zero.
