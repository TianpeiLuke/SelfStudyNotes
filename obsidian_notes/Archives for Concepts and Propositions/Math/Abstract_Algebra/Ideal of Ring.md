## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Left (Right) Ideal of Ring

>[!important] Definition
>For an arbitrary *ring* $(R,+,\cdot )$, let $(R,+)$ be its *abelian group*. 
>
>A *subset* $I$ is called a **left ideal** *of* $R$ if it is an *additive subgroup* of $R$ that "*absorbs multiplication* from *the left* by elements of $R$"; 
>
>That is, $I$ is a **left ideal** if it satisfies the following two conditions:
>
>- $(I,+)$ is a **subgroup** of $(R,+)$,
>- For every $r\in R$ and every $x\in I$, the **product** $$rx \in I.$$

>[!important] Definition
>$I$ is the **right ideal** when we replace the product above with
>$$
>xr \in I, \quad \forall r \in R, x\in I
>$$

>[!important] Definition
>$I$ is an **(two sided) ideal** if it is both *left ideal* and *right ideal*.
