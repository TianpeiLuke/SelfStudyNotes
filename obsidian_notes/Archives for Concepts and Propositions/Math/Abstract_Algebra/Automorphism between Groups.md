## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Automorphism between Groups

>[!important] Definition
>A **bijective** *group homomorphism* from $(G,∗)$ to $(G,∗)$ itself is a **group automorphism**.
>
>That is, for a *group homomorphism* $h: (G,∗) \to (G,∗)$,  we have 
>$$
>h(a * b) = h(a) * h(b)
>$$
>and we can find an *inverse map* $h^{-1}: (G,∗) \to (G,∗)$ that is also a *group homomorphism*, i.e.
>$$
>h^{-1}(a * b) = h^{-1}(a) * h^{-1}(b)
>$$

>[!important]
>Denote $\text{Aut}(G)$ as **the set of all automorphisms** on $G$.


## Explanation

>[!important]
>An **automorphism** between groups is **both** an **isomorphism** and an **endomorphism** 

- [[Endomorphism between Groups]]
- [[Isomorphism between Groups]]

## Properties

>[!important] Proposition
>If $G$ is a **group**, then $\text{Aut}(G)$, i.e. **the set of all automorphisms** on $G$, is also a **group**, with the *multiplication operation* defined by the **composition product**.
