## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Minimal and Maximal Property of Graph

![[Graph Operations and Subgraph#^69d7e9]]

>[!important] Definition
>Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. 
>
>We call $G$ **edge-maximal** with a given *graph property* if
>- $G$ itself has the *property* 
>- *no graph* $G' = (V,F)$ with more edges $F \supsetneq E$ has the property.

- [[Graph Property]]

>[!important] Definition
>More generally, when we call a graph $G$ **minimal** or **maximal** with *some property*, but have not specified any particular *ordering*, we are referring to the **subgraph relation**.
