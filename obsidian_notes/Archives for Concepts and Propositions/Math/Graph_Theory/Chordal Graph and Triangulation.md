## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Chordal Graph and Triangulation

>[!important] Definition
>A graph is **chordal** (or **chordal triangulated**) if each of its *cycles* of *length* at least $4$ has a *chord*, i.e. if it contains no induced cycles other than *triangles*.

>[!important] Definition
>The process of turning a graph $\mathcal{H}$ into a *chordal graph* is also called **triangulation**, since it ensures that the *largest unbroken cycle* in the graph is a *triangle*.
