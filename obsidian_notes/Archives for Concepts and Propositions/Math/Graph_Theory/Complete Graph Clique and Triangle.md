## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Complete Graph and Triangle

>[!important] Definition
>If *every pair* of vertices in $G$ are *adjacent* to each other, then $G$ is a **complete graph**. 
>
>A complete graph on $n$ vertices is a $K^n$.

>[!important] Definition
>
>A complete graph on $3$ vertices, $K^3$, is called a **triangle**.

>[!important] Definition
>A *complete subgraph* $\mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{G}$ is called a **clique**.

## Explanation



## Degree


>[!important]
>The **degree** of every vertices $v$ in a complete $n$-graph is $$d(v) = n - 1$$ for $n \ge 1$. 
>
>Also $$d(K^n) = \delta(K^n) = \Delta(K^n) = n - 1$$

## Connectivity

>[!important]
>The **connectivity** of a complete $n$-graph is $$\kappa(K^n) = n - 1$$ for $n \ge 1$
