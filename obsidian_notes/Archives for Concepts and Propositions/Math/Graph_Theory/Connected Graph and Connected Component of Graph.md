## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Connected Graph

>[!important] Definition
>A graph $\mathcal{G}$ is called **connected** if it is *non-empty* and *any two* of its vertices are linked by a *path* in $G$.
>
>If $U \subseteq V(\mathcal{G})$ and $G[U]$ is *connected*, we also call $U$ itself **connected** *in* $\mathcal{G}$.

- [[Paths in Graph and Length of Path]]

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\mathcal{G} =(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ be a graph. 
>
>A *maximal connected subgraph* of $\mathcal{G}$ is a **component** of $\mathcal{G}$.
