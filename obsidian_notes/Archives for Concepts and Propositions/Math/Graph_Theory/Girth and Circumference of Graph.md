## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Girth and Circumference of Graph

![[Cycles in Graph#^b22c6e]]

>[!important] Definition
>The *minimum length* of a cycle contained in a graph $G$ is the **girth** $g(G)$ of $G$.
>
>The *maximum length* of a cycle contained in a graph $G$ is the **circumference** of $G$.

>[!info]
>If $G$ does not contain a cycle, then $g(G)= \infty$, and the *circumference of $G$ is zero*.


## Explanation


## Property

>[!important] Proposition
>Every graph $G$ contains a **path** of **length** $\delta(G)$ and a **cycle** of **length** *at least* $\delta(G) + 1.$

- [[Degree of Vertex]]

>[!info]
>If a graph has **large minimum degree**, it contains **long paths** and **cycles**.
