## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Graph Homomorphism

>[!important] Definition
>Let $G =(V, E)$ and $G' =(V',E')$ be *two graphs*. 
>
>A map $$\varphi: V \to V'$$ is a **homomorphism** from $G$ to $G'$ if it *preserves the __adjacency__* of *vertices*, that is, $$\{ x, y \} \in E \implies \{ \varphi(x), \varphi(y) \} \in E'.$$
