## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Cycles in Graph

![[Paths in Graph and Length of Path#^a0a3e2]]

>[!important] Definition
>If $P = x_{0} \,{}\ldots{}\,x_{k-1}$ is a *path* and $k \ge 3$,  then the graph $$C := P + x_{k-1}x_{0}$$ is called a **cycle**.
>
>- We often denote a *cycle* by its *(cyclic) sequence of vertices*; the above cycle $C$ might be written as $$x_{0}\,{}\ldots{}\,x_{k-1}x_{0}.$$
>
>The **length** of *a cycle* is its *number of edges or vertices*.
>
>The cycle of length $k$ is called a **$k$-cycle** and denote by $C^{k}.$
