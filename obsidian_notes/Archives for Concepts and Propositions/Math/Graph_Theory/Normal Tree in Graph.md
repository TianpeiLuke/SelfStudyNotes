## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Normal Tree in Graph

![[Tree Graph and Forest#^90f857]]

![[Root and Rooted Tree#^f3cb7e]]

>[!important] Definition
>A rooted tree $T$ contained in a graph $G$ is called **normal** *in* $G$ if the *ends* of every $T$-path in $G$ are *comparable* in the *tree-order* of $T$.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>If $T$ **spans** $G$, $T$ is **normal**  in $G$ if two vertices of $T$ must be *comparable* in tree-order whenever they are *adjacent* in $G$.
