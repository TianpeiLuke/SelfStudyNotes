## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Epimorphism between Groups

>[!important] Definition
>Given two *groups*, $(G,∗)$ and $(H,\cdot)$, a **group epimorphism** from $(G,∗)$ to $(H,\cdot)$ is an **surjective** *group homomorphism*.
>
>That is, for a *group homomorphism* $h: (G,∗) \to (H,\cdot)$,  we have
>$$
>\forall a \in H \implies \exists b\in G, \text{ such that }h(b) = a
