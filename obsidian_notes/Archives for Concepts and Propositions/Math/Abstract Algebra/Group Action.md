## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Group Action

>[!important] Definition
>A **group action** of a *group* $G$ on a *set* $A$ is a map from $G \times A$ to $A$, written as 
>$$
>g \cdot a, \quad \forall g\in G,\,\; a \in A 
>$$
>satisfying the following properties:
>- **Associativity on Acton**: for all $g_{1}, g_{2} \in G$ and $a\in A$
>$$
>g_{1} \cdot (g_{2} \cdot a) = (g_{1} \cdot g_{2}) \cdot a.
>$$
>- **Identity Action**: for all $a\in A$,
>  $$
>  1_{G} \cdot a = a.
> $$
> 
>We say say $G$ is **a group acting on a set** $A$.
