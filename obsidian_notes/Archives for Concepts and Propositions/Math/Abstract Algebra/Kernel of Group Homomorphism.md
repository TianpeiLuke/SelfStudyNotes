## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Kernel of Group Homomorphism

>[!important] Definition
>Given two *groups*, $(G,∗)$ and $(H,\cdot)$, and $f: (G,∗) \to (H,\cdot)$, is a *group homomorphism.*
>
>The **kernel** of $f$ is defined as the set
>$$
>\text{ker}(f) = \{ x\in G: f(x) = 1_{H} \}
>$$
>where $1_{H}$ is the identity element in $H$
