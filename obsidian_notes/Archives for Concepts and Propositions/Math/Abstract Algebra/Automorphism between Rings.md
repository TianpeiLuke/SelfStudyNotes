## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Automorphism between Rings

>[!important] Definition




>[!important]
>Denote $\text{Aut}(G)$ as **the set of all automorphisms** on $G$.


## Explanation

>[!important]
>An **automorphism** between groups is **both** an **isomorphism** and an **endomorphism** 

- [[Endomorphism between Rings]]
- [[Isomorphism between Rings]]

## Properties

>[!important] Proposition
>If $G$ is a **group**, then $\text{Aut}(G)$, i.e. **the set of all automorphisms** on $G$, is also a **group**, with the *multiplication operation* defined by the **composition product**.
