>[!important] Definition
>A *ring* $R$ *with identity $1$*, where $1 \neq 0$, is called a **division ring** (or **skew field**) if every nonzero element $a\in R$ has a **multiplicative inverse**.
>
>That is, there exists $b\in R$, such that 
>$$
>a \times b = b \times a = 1_{R}
>$$
>Such element is denoted as $b:= a^{-1}$.
