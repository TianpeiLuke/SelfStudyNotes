## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**:   Dual Representation of Convex Set

>[!important] Theorem
>If $K$ is a **closed convex** set in a *normed space*, then $K$ is equal to the **intersection** of *all* the **closed half-spaces** that *contain* it. 

- This theorem is represented analytically via support functional  [[Support functional of Convex Set]]
- The basis of this theorem is [[Hahn-Banach Theorem Geometric Form and Mazur Theorem]]



## Explanation

>[!important]
>Theorem above is often regarded as **the geometric foundation** of **duality theory** for **convex sets**. 
>


>[!info]
>By associating *closed hyperplanes* (or *half-spaces*) with elements of $X^{*}$, the theorem expresses **a convex set in $X$ as a collection of elements in $X^{*}$**. See more in [[Convex Analysis by Rockafellar]].
