## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Dual Space of Hilbert Space


>[!important] Definition
>The space of all *complex-valued linear functionals* on $\mathcal{H}$,  $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}, \mathbb{C})$ is called the **dual space** of $\mathcal{H}$ and is denoted by $\mathcal{H}^{*}$. 

- [[Space of Bounded Linear Operators]]

>[!important] Definition
>The elements of $\mathcal{H}^{*}$ are called **continuous linear functionals**. That is, the dual space $\mathcal{H}^{*}$ is **the space of continuous linear functionals** on $\mathcal{H}$. 


## Explanation

>[!info]
>The *dual space* $\mathcal{H}^{*}$ is also called **covector space** *with respect to* a vector space $\mathcal{H}$ and *the linear functionals* are called **covectors**. 
>
>This terms are mostly used in *differential geometry* when the vector space is *the tangent space*.
