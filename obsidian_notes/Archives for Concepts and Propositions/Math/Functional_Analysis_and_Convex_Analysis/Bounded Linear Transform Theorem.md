## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Bounded Linear Transform Theorem

>[!important] Theorem
>Suppose $T$ is a **bounded linear transformation** from a *normed linear space* $(V_1, \lVert \cdot \rVert_{1})$ to a **complete** *normed* linear space $(V_2, \lVert \cdot \rVert_{2})$. 
>
>Then $T$ can be **uniquely extended** to a *bounded linear transformation* (with the same bound), $\widetilde{T}$, from the **completion** of $V_1$ to $(V_2, \lVert \cdot \rVert_{2})$.
