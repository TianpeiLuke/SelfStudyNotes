## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Hellinger-Toeplitz Theorem

>[!important] Open Mapping Theorem
>Let $A$ be an **everywhere defined** *linear operator* on a **Hilbert space** $\mathcal{H}$ with
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \left\langle  Ax\,,\, y   \right\rangle &= \left\langle  x\,,\,Ay    \right\rangle
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
>for all $x, y \in \mathcal{H}$; that is $A$ is **self-adjoint**. 
>
>Then $A$ is **bounded**.

## Explanation

>[!important]
>This theorem confirms that an **unbounded self-adjoint operator** in *Hilbert space* can only be defined **within a domain** $\mathcal{D}$.
