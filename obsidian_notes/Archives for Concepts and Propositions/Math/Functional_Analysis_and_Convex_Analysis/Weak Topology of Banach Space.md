## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Weak Topology of Banach Space


>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be a *Banach space* with **dual space** $X^{*}$. 
>
>The **weak topology** on $X$ is *the weakest topology* on $X$ so that $f(x)$ is **continuous** for *all* $f \in X^{*}$.

- [[Weak Topology Generated by Functions]]

## Explanation


>[!important]
>**The weak topology** in Banach space does **not require a metric topology in original space**. This is one of the main reasons we have introduced topological spaces.

## Sub-basis

>[!important]
>The **sub-basis** for *weak topology* in Banach space is defined as
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> S(f,U) = f^{-1}(U) := \set{x \in X: f(x) \in U}
> \end{align*}
> $$
> where  $f \in X^{*}$ is any functional in dual space, and $U \in \mathbb{R}$ is any open subset in $\mathbb{R}$

>[!info]
>Thus a **neighborhood base** *at zero* for *the weak topology* is given by the **union** of sets of the form
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \mathcal{N}(f_1 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, f_n; \epsilon) &= \set{x: \lvert f_{j}(x) \rvert  <\epsilon; \; j= 1 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, n}
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
>where $n$ chosen as any finite number. 
> 
>The neighborhoods of zero contain **cylinders** with **finite-dimensional** *open bases*. 

## Hausdorff

>[!important] Proposition
>The space $X$ under **weak topology** is a **Hausdorff space**.

## Weak Convergence

>[!important]
>A net $\{x_{\alpha}\}$ **converges weakly** to $x$, written $x_\alpha \stackrel{w}{\rightarrow} x$, *if and only if* $f(x_{\alpha}) \rightarrow f(x)$ for all $f \in X^{*}$.

## Weak Topology on Hilbert Space

- Due to existence of *orthonormal basis* in Hilbert Space, the weak topology on Hilbert Space has special form.
