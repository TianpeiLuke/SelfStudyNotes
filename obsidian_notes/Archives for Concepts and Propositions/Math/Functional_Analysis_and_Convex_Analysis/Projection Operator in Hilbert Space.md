## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Projection Operator in Hilbert Space

>[!important] Definition
>A *bounded linear operator* $P \in  \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H})$ on a *Hilbert space* $\mathcal{H}$ is called the **projection operator** or **projection** if it is *idempotent*
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> P^{2} = P 
> \end{align*}

>[!important] Definition
>If in addition $P$ is *self-adjoint*
>$$
>P^{*} = P,
>$$
>then $P$ is called an **orthogonal projection**.
