## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Extreme Points of Polyhedron

![[Extreme Points of Convex Set of Locally Convex Space#^36426c]]

>[!important] Definition
>Let $P$ be a *polyhedron*. 
>
>A vector $x\in P$ is an **exÂ­treme point** of $P$ if we *cannot find* two vectors $y, z \in P$, both *different from* $x$, and a scalar $\lambda\in [0,1]$ such that $$x = \lambda\,y + (1- \lambda)\,z.$$
>
>That is, $x\in P$ is an **extreme point** if and only if
> $$(\exists \lambda \in [0,1])\;\; x = \lambda u + (1- \lambda)v\; \implies u = v = x.$$

## Explanation



## Krein-Milman Theorem and Characterization of Extreme Points

>[!important] Proposition
>Any non-empty **polyhedron** $P$ can be written as the convex hull of **extreme points**. 
>
>Conversely, the convex hull of  any *finite collection of vectors* is a **polytope**.
