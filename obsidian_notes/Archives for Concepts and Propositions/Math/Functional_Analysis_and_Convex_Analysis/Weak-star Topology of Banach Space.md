## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Weak$^*$ Topology of Banach Space


>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ be a *normed vector space* and $X^{*}$ be its *dual space.* 
>
>The **weak$^{*}$ topology** on $X^{*}$ is *the weakest topology* on $X^{*}$ so that $f(x)$ is **continuous** ***for all*** $x \in X$.

- [[Weak Topology of Banach Space]]

>[!important]
>A **weak$^{*}$ topology** on $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$, the space of Radon measures on $\mathcal{X}$ with $\mathcal{X}$ being *compact Hausdorff space*, is often called the **vague  topology**. 


>[!info]
>- Weak topology is for *points*, defined as a topology of original space $X$.  
>- Weak$^{*}$ topology is for *functionals*, defined as a topology of *dual space* $X^{*}$.


## Explanation


>[!important]
>**The weak$^{*}$ topology** in dual of function space is the **topology** of **pointwise convergence**:
>$$
>\begin{align*}
>f_{\alpha} \rightarrow  f \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad f_{\alpha}(x) \rightarrow  f(x) \text{ for all }x \in X.
>\end{align*}
>$$

- [[Topology of Pointwise Convergence]]

>[!info]
>Moreover, *the weak*$^{*}$ *topology* is the **product topology** on **product space** $\mathbb{R}^X$.
>
>Here the functions are the *coordinate map functions*.

## Sub-basis

>[!important]
>The **sub-basis** for *weak\* topology* in Banach space is defined as
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> S(x, U) = \set{f \in X^{*}: f(x) \in U}.
> \end{align*}
> $$
> where $x\in X$ is any point in $X$, and $U \in \mathbb{R}$ is any open subset in $\mathbb{R}.$

- This is the same as the definition in [[Topology of Pointwise Convergence]]


## Convergence in Distribution

>[!info]
>Convergence under the weak\*   topology in **probability space** is called the **convergence in distribution.**

- [[A Probability Path by Resnick]]
- [[Probability and Measure by Billingsley]]


>[!info]
 >It is also called the **weak convergence** in **probability theory**, causing a lot of confusions. 
 >
 >Note the the *weak convergence* in probability theory is actually *weak\* convergence* in functional analysis.

>[!info]
>In probability theory, *the convergence in distribution* is **the convergence of measures**. $\mu_{n} \to \mu$. 
>
>By the Risez-Markov Representation Theorem, it is essentially **the convergence of functionals** in the *dual space* $(\mathbb{R}^{\Omega})^{*}$ of the space of random variables $\mathbb{R}^{\Omega}$.
