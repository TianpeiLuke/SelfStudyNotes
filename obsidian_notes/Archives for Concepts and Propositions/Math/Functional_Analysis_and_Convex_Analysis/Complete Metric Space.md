## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Complete Metric Space


>[!important] Definition
>A *metric space* in which **all Cauchy sequences converge** is called **complete**.

- [[Cauchy Sequence]]

>[!info]
>This concept can be extended to [[Complete Topological Vector Space]]

## Explanation



## Compactness

>[!important] Proposition
>Every **compact** *metric space* is **complete**.

- [[Compactness]]
- [[Sequential Compactness]]

>[!important] Proposition
>A **metric space** $(X, d)$ is **compact** *if and only if* it is **totally bounded** and **complete**.

- [[Total Boundedness]]
