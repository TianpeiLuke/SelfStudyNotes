## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Spectrum of Self-Adjoint Linear Operator

>[!important] Proposition
>Let $Î¤$ be a **self-adjoint operator** on a *Hilbert space* $\mathcal{H}$. 
>
>Then, 
>
>- $T$ has **no residual spectrum**, i.e. $$\sigma_{r}(T) = \emptyset.$$ 
>- $$\sigma(T)$$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. That is, all spectrum is *real-valued*. 
>- **Eigenvectors** corresponding to **distinct eigenvalues** of $T$ are **orthogonal**.
