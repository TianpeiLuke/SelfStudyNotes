## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Compact Operator

>[!important] Definition
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be *Banach spaces*. 
>
>An operator $T \in \mathcal{L}(X, Y)$ is called **compact** (or **completely continuous**) if $T$ takes *bounded sets* in $X$ into *precompact sets* in $Y$.

>[!important] Definition
>Equivalently, $T$ is **compact** *if and only if* for every **bounded sequence** $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$, $\{T x_n\}$ has a **subsequence convergent** in $Y$.
