## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Orthogonality in Inner Product Space

>[!info]
>The geometric interpretation of inner product is **the angle** between two vectors. That is, 
>$$
>\cos(\theta) = \frac{\left\langle x\,,\, y \right\rangle}{\sqrt{\left\langle x \,,\,x \right\rangle }\; \sqrt{\left\langle y\,,\,y \right\rangle}}
>$$


>[!important] Definition
>Two vectors, $x$ and $y$, in an inner product space $V$ are said to be **orthogonal** if 
>$$\left\langle x \,,\, y \right\rangle  = 0.$$ 
>
>A collection $\{x_n\}$ of vectors in $V$ is called **an orthonormal set** if 
>- $\left\langle x_{i} \,,\, x_{i} \right\rangle = 1$ for all $i$, and 
>- $\left\langle x_{i} \,,\, x_{j} \right\rangle = 0$ if $i\neq j$.


## Explanation

>[!info]
>The definition of orthogonality comes with the definition of inner product. It is a *fundamental geometric property* that separate inner product space from other normed spaces.
