## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**:  Riesz-Fisher Theorem for Completeness of $L^p$ Space

![[Lp Space#^5f512c]]

- [[Lp Space]]


>[!important] Riesz-Fisher Theorem
>Let $(X, \mathscr{F}, \mu)$ be a *measure space* and **$1 \le p < \infty$**. 
>
>Then $L^p(X, \mu)$ is a **Banach space** with norm $$\lVert f \rVert_{p} = \left(\int_{X} |f|^p d\mu \right)^{1 / p}.$$
>
>Moreover, if a sequence $\{ f_{n} \}$ in $L^p(X, \mu)$ **converges in $L^p(X, \mu)$** to a function $f$ in $L^p(X, \mu)$, then a subsequence converges **pointwise almost everywhere** on $X$ to $f$.
