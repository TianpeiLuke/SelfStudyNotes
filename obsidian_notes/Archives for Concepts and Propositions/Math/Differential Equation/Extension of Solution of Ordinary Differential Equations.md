## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Extension of Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations

>[!important] Theorem
>Let $J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$ be *open subsets*, and suppose that $f: U \times J \times \Lambda \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a *smooth function*, and $(x_{0}, t_{0},\lambda_{0}) \in U \times J \times \Lambda$.
>
>If the **maximal open internal** of *existence* of the solution $t \mapsto \phi(t)$ is given by $(\alpha, \beta)$, with $-\infty \le \alpha < \beta < \infty$, then
>$$
>|\phi(t)| \to \partial U\, \qquad \text{ or } \qquad |\phi(t)| \to \infty
>$$
>as $t \to \beta.$

>[!important] Definition
>If for some *finite* $T$, $$\lim_{ t \to T }\lvert \phi(t) \rvert  \to \infty,$$ we say that *the solution* **blows up in finite time**.
