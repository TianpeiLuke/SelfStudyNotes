## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Exponential Map of Lie Group and Matrix Lie Group

![[One-Parameter Subgroup of Lie Group as Integral Curve#^477259]]

>[!important] Definition
>Let $G$ be a *Lie group* with *Lie algebra* $\mathfrak{g}$.
>
>The **exponential map** of $G$ is defined as a map $$\exp: \mathfrak{g} \to G$$ as follows:
>- for any $X \in \mathfrak{g}$, the *exponential map* of $X$ $$\exp(X) = \gamma(1)$$ where 
>	- $\gamma$ is the *one-parameter subgroup* generated by $X$, 
>	- or equivalently, $\gamma$ is the *integral curve* of $X$, starting at $I$.

### Matrix Lie Group

![[Matrix Exponential as Global Flow in General Linear Group#^926b51]]

>[!important] Definition
>Let $G$ be a *matrix Lie group* with *Lie algebra* $\mathfrak{g}$.
>
>The **exponential map** of $G$ is defined as a map $$\exp: \mathfrak{g} \to G$$ which is the *matrix exponential* restricted to the *Lie algebra* $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$, i.e. for every $X\in \mathfrak{g}$,  $$\exp(X) = e^{X}$$

## Explanation

>[!info] 
>- This definition of *exponential map* in **Lie group** via the **flow (one-parameter subgroup)** is *similar to*
>- the traditional definition of *exponential map* in **general smooth manifold** via the **parallel transport**
>  
>The former is based on the **Lie derivative** while the later is based on **parallel transport.**
