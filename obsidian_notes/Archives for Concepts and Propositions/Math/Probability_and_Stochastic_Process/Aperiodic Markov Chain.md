>[!important] Definition
>A *discrete-time Markov chain* $(X_{n})$  on $\mathcal{X}$ is **aperiodic** is the period of the chain $d = 1$.


>[!important] Definition
>A *discrete-time Markov chain* $(X_{n})$  on $\mathcal{X}$ is **strongly aperiodic** if 
>- the *period* of the chain $d = 1$;
>- and there exists a *small set* $A$ and a *minorizing measure* $\nu_{1}$ such that $$\nu_{1}(A) > 0$$ i.e. it is possible to go from $A$ to $A$ in one step.
