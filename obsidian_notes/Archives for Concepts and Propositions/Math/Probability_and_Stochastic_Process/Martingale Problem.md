## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Martingale Problem


![[Infinitesimal Generator of Stochastic Differential Equation#^1bd4b1]]


>[!important] Definition
>The **martingale problem** *for the operator* $L$ is defined as follows:
>
>For each $x\in \mathbb{R}$, $s >0$, find a **probability measure** $\mathcal{P}_{x,s}$ on $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$ such that 
>- $$\mathcal{P}_{x,s}(X(u) =x, \; 0 \le u \le s)  = 1$$
>- For any twice differentiable function $f$ *vanishing outside a finite interval* the following process is a **martingale** under $\mathcal{P}_{x,s}$ with respect to $\mathcal{F}_{t}$
>$$
>f\left(X(t)\right) - \int_{s}^{t}\,\left(L\,f\right)\left(X(u)\right)\,du
>$$
>
>If there exists *exactly one solution* to the martingale problem, it is said that the martingale problem is **well-posed**.

>The first condition of the martingale problem states that the system **fixed** at a **constant initial state** $x$ *before* $s$.
