## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Local Property of Stochastic Process

>[!important] Definition
>A **property** of a *stochastic process* $X_{t}$ is said to hold **locally** if there exists a sequence of *stopping times* $\{\tau_{n}  \}$, called the **localizing sequence**, such that
>- $\tau_{n} \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$;
>- for each $n$, the **stopped process** $$X_{t \wedge \tau_{n}}$$ has *this property*.
