## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Homogeneous Linear Stochastic Differential Equation

![[Linear Stochastic Differential Equation#^6bba38]]

>[!important] Definition
>A *linear stochastic differential equation* is called **homogeneous** if $c \equiv E \equiv0$ for $t\in [0,T].$ 
>
>That is, the **homogeneous linear stochastic differential equation** has the form
>$$
>\left\{ 
>\begin{align*}
>dX &= D(t)\,X\;dt + F(t)\,X\,dW\\
>X(0)&= X_{0}
>\end{align*}
>\right.
>$$ 
>
>It is called *linear in* **narrow sense** if $F \equiv 0$, i.e.
>$$
>\left\{ 
>\begin{align*}
>dX &= \left[c(t) + D(t)\,X\right]\;dt + E(t)\,dW\\
>X(0)&= X_{0}
>\end{align*}
