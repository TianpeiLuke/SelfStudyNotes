## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Linear Stochastic Differential Equation

![[Stochastic Differential Equations#^dda568]]


>[!important] Definition
>The stochastic differential equation
>$$
>\left\{ 
>\begin{align*}
>dX(t) &= b\left( X(t), t\right)\,dt + A\left( X(t), t \right)\,dW\\

>is called **linear** if the **coefficients** $b$ and $A$ has the following form
>- $$b(x, t) := c(t) + D(t)\,x$$ for $$c: [0,T] \to \mathbb{R}^n, \quad D: [0,T] \to \mathbb{M}^{n\times n}$$
>- $$A(x, t) := E(t) + F(t)\,x$$ for $$E: [0,T] \to \mathbb{M}^{n\times m}, \quad F: [0,T] \to L(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{M}^{n\times m}),$$ the space of bounded linear map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{M}^{n\times m}.$

>If, in addition, $F \equiv 0$, then we called it **linear stochastic differential equation** in **narrow sense**.

## Example

>[!example]
>The **Langevin equation** is a *linear stochastic differential equation (in narrow sense)*
>$$
>\left\{
>\begin{align*}
> dX &= - \beta X\,dt + \sigma\, dW\\
> X(0) &= X_{0}
>\end{align*}
>\right.
>$$
>where $c(t) = 0$, $D(t)= -\beta$,  $E(t)= \sigma$, and $F(t) = 0.$
>
>Its solution is the **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.**
