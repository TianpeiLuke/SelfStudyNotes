## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Filtration

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\{X_n, n \ge 0\}$ be a stochastic process on a measure space $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$.
>
>A collection of $\sigma$-fields $\{\mathscr{F}_n, n \ge 0\}$ is called a **filtration**, if $\{\mathscr{F}_n, n \ge 0\}$ is an *increasing sub $\sigma$-fields* of $\mathscr{F}$
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \mathscr{F}_0 \subseteq \mathscr{F}_1 \subseteq \mathscr{F}_2  \,{\subseteq}\ldots{\subseteq}\, \mathscr{F}.
> \end{align*}

## Explanation

>[!important]
>Using the interpretation of **$\sigma$-algebras encoding information**, if 
>- $\{\mathscr{F}_{t}: t\ge 0\}$ is thought of as **the knowledge available at time $t$**,  then 
>- $\mathscr{F}_{\tau}$ is the information available **at the random time** $\tau$.
