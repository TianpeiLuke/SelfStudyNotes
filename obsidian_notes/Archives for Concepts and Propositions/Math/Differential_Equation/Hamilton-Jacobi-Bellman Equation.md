## Explanation

>[!info]
>The **Hamilton-Jacobi equation** is a **nonlinear PDE**.

>[!info]
>The **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation** is a nonlinear PDE that provides **necessary and sufficient conditions** for *optimality* of a control with respect to a loss function. 
>- Its solution is the **value function** of the optimal control problem which, once known, can be used to obtain the optimal control by taking the *maximizer (or minimizer)* of the *Hamiltonian* involved in the HJB equation.
