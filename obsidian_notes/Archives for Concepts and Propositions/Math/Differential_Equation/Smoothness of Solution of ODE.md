## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Continuous Dependency of Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations

>[!important] Theorem
>Let $J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$ be *open subsets*, and suppose that $f: U \times J \times \Lambda \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a **smooth function**, and $(x_{0}, t_{0},\lambda_{0}) \in U \times J \times \Lambda$.
>
>Then the **solution** $\phi : U_{0} \times J_{0} \times  J_{0} \times \Lambda_{0} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ of the differential equation
>$$
>\begin{align*}
> \frac{d}{dt} x &= f(x, t, \lambda)
>\end{align*}
>$$
>is a **smooth function**.
>
>Moreover, if $f\in \mathcal{C}^{k}$, i.e. $f$ is *$k$-times continuous differentiable* for some $k=1, 2 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, \infty$, then the **solution** is also *$k$-times continuous differentiable*, i.e. $\phi \in \mathcal{C}^{k}.$
