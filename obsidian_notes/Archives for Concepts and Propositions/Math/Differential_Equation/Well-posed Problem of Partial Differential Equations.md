## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Well-posed Problem of Partial Differential Equations


>[!important] Definition
>We say that a given problem for a partial differential equation is **well-posed** if
>- the problem **has a solution**;
>- this solution is **unique**;
>- the solution **depends continuous on** the data given in the problem.

## Explanation

>[!info]
>We can see that **the initial value problem** for **ordinary differential equation** is **well-posed**. 
>
>- ODE with initial value **always has a solution**; [[Existence and Uniqueness of Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations]]
>- This solution is **unique**; [[Existence and Uniqueness of Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations]]
>- This solution **depends continuous** on the data; [[Smoothness of Solution of ODE]]
