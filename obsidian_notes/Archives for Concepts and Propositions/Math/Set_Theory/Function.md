## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: *Rule of Assignment* and *Function*

>[!important] Definition
>A **rule of assignment** is a subset $r$ of the *cartesian product* $C \times D$ of two sets, having the property that each element of $C$ appears as *the first coordinate*  **at most one ordered pair** *belonging to $r$*.
>
>Thus, a subset $r$ of $C \times D$ is **a rule of assignment** if
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> [(c, d) \in r\text{ and }(c, d') \in r] \Rightarrow [d = d'].
> \end{align*}
>$$ 

>[!important] Definition
>Given a rule of assignment $r$, 
>- **the domain** of $r$ is defined to be the *subset* of $C$ consisting **all first coordinates** of elements of $r$, and 
>- **the image (co-domain)** set of $r$ is defined as the *subset* of $D$ consisting of **all second coordinates** of elements of $r$.

>[!important] Definition
>A **function** $f$ is *a rule of assignment* $r$, together with a set $B$ that *contains the image set* of $r$.
