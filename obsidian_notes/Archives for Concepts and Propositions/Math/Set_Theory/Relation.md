## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Relation

>[!important] Definition
>A **relation** on a set $A$ is a *subset* $R$ of **the cartesian product** $A \times A$.
>
>If $R$ is a relation on $A$, we use the notation $xRy$ to mean the same thing as $(x, y) \in R$. We read it **"$x$ is in the relation $R$ to $y$."**



## Explanation

>[!example]
>In a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, the edge set represents a relation: for every $u, v$ in $\mathcal{V}$,
>$$
>uRv \implies (u,v) \in \mathcal{E} \subset \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V}
>$$
>That is, $R := \mathcal{E}.$
