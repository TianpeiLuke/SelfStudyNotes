## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Indexed Family of Sets

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a nonempty *collection of sets*. 
>
>An **indexing function** for $\mathscr{A}$ is a *surjective function* $f$ from some set $J$, called **the index set**, to $\mathscr{A}$.

>[!important] Definition
>The *collection* $\mathscr{A}$, together with *the indexing function* $f$, is called an **indexed family of sets**. 

>[!important] Definition
>Given $\alpha \in J$, we shall *denote the set* $f(\alpha)$ by the symbol $$A_{\alpha}.$$ 
>
>And we shall denote the indexed family itself by the symbol
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \set{A_{\alpha}}_{\alpha \in J},
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
> which is read "*the family of all $A_{\alpha}$, as a ranges over $J$.*" 
> 
> Sometimes we write merely $\{A_{\alpha}\}$, if it is clear what the index set is.
