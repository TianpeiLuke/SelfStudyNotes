## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: *Upper Bound* and *Supremum* of Set

>[!important] Definition
>We say that the *subset* $A_0$ of $A$ is **bounded above** if there is *an element* $b$ of **$A$** such that $x \le b$ for every $x \in A_0$; 
>
>the element $b \in A$ is called an **upper bound** for $A_0$. 

>[!important] Definition
>If *the set of all upper bounds* for $A_0$ has a *smallest element*, that element is called **the least upper bound**, or **the supremum**, of $A_0$. 
>
>It is denoted by $$\sup A_0,$$ it may or *may not belong to* $A_0$.  If it *does*, it is **the largest element** of **$A_0$**.
