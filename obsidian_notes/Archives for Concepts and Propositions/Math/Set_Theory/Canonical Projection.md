## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Canonical Projection

>[!important] Definition
>Let $\pi_X : X \times Y \rightarrow X$ be defined by the equation
>$$
> \begin{align*}
> \pi_X (x, y) = x;
> \end{align*}
>$$
>and  
> $\pi_Y : X \times Y \rightarrow Y$ he defined by the equation
>$$ 
> \begin{align*}
> \pi_Y (x, y) = y.
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
>
>The maps $\pi_X$ and $\pi_Y$ are called **the (canonical) projections** of $X \times Y$ *onto* its **first** and **second factors**, respectively.


## Explanation



## Properties

>[!important]
>Both $\pi_X$ and $\pi_Y$ are **surjective**. 

- [[Surjective Function]]

>[!important]
>If $U$ is an **open** subset of $X$, then the set $\pi_1^{-1}(U)$ is precisely the set $U \times Y$, which is **open** in $X \times Y$. 
>
>Similarly, if $V$ is **open** in $Y$, then $\pi_2^{-1}(V) = X \times V$ which is also **open** in $X \times Y$.

>[!important]
>The canonical projections are *continuous* under **the product topology**.
