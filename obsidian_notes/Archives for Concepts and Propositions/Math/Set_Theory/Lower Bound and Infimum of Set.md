## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: *Lower Bound* and *Infimum* of Subset

>[!important] Definition
>We say that the *subset* $A_0$ of $A$ is **bounded below** if there is *an element* $a$ of **$A$** such that $a \le x$ for every $x \in A_0$; 
>
>the element $a \in A$ is called an **lower bound** for $A_0$. 

>[!important] Definition
>If *the set of all lower bounds* for $A_0$ has a *largest element*, that element is called **the greatest lower bound**, or **the infimum**, of $A_0$. 
>
>It is denoted by $$\inf A_0,$$ it may or *may not belong to* $A_0$.  If it *does*, it is **the smallest element** of **$A_0$**.
