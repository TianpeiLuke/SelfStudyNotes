## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Quotient Set

>[!important] Definition
>The *set of all equivalence classes* of $X$ by $\sim$, denoted $$X/{\mathord {\sim }}:= \{[x]: x \in X \},$$ is **the quotient set** of $X$ by $\sim$.  
>
>By property of equivalence class, $X /\sim$ defines a **partition** of $X$.
>$$X = \bigcup_{C \in X/\sim}C.$$

## Explanation


>[!important]
>By checking structure and properties of the quotient set $X / \sim$, we are considering structures and properties that are **invariant to the transform** defined by $\sim$.

>[!important]
>In general, consider some properties that are **irrelevant** to our problem, treating all elements **with or without such property** as an *equivalent relationship* would lead us to **the quotient set** where such *property* **does not matter** at all.    

>[!info]
>Consider all points in one *equivalence class* as the **duplicates** of one sample. The operation of obtaining *quotient set* is seen as a **deduplication process**.
