## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: Well Ordering Theorem or **Zermelo's theorem**

>[!important] Theorem
>If $A$ is a set, there **exists** an *order relation* on $A$ that is a **well-ordering.**

- [[Well Ordered Set]]


## Explanation

>[!info]
>The proof of *Well-Ordering Theorem* is based on a **construction** involving *an infinite number of __arbitrary choices__*, that is, a construction involving **the Choice Axiom**.

- [[Axiom of Choice]]

## Equivalent Theorems

>[!important]
>The following three fundamental theorems are equivalent:
>- **Well-Ordering Theorem**: [[Well Ordering Theorem]] 
>- **The Axiom of Choice**: [[Axiom of Choice]]
>- **Zorn's Lemma**: [[Zorn Lemma]]
