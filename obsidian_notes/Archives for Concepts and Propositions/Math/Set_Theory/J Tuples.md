## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: $J$-Tuples

>[!important] Definition
>Let $J$ be an **index set**. 
>
>Given a set $X$, we define a **$J$-tuple** of *elements* of $X$ to be a function $$x : J \rightarrow X.$$ 
>
>If $\alpha$ is an element of $J$, we often denote the *value* of $X$ **at** $\alpha$ by $X_{\alpha}$ rather than $x(\alpha)$; we call it **the $\alpha$-th coordinate** of $x$.
>
 >And we often *denote the function $x$ itself* by the symbol
 >$$
> \begin{align*}
> (x_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in J}
> \end{align*}
>$$ 
> which is as close as we can come to a "*tuple notation*" for an *arbitrary index set* $J$.
