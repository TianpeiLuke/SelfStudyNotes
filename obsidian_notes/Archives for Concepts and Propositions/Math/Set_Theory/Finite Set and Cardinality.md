## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Finite Set and Cardinality

>[!important] Definition
> A set $A$ is said to be **finite** if it admits a *bijection* with some section of *positive integers*. That is, either $A$ is an *empty set* or there exists some $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and a *bijection* $f$, such that  $$f: A \rightarrow \{ 1 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, n \}$$

>[!important] Definition
> If there exists some $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and a *bijection* $f$, such that  $$f: A \rightarrow \{ 1 \,{,}\ldots{,}\, n \}.$$
> 
>Then we say $A$ **has cardinality $n$.** Denote as $$\text{card}(A) = n,$$ or $$|A| = n$$
>
>If $A = \emptyset$, then $$\text{card}(A) = 0.$$
