## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Partition of Set

>[!important] Definition
>A **partition** of a set $A$ is a *collection* of **disjoint** *nonempty* subsets of $A$ whose **union** is all of $A$.
>
>That is, a partition $\mathscr{A}$ of $A$ is defined as follows: 
>- Every element $U$ of $\mathscr{A}$ is a subset of $A$.
>- For any $U, V\in \mathscr{A}$, $U\cap V = \emptyset.$
>- The following holds $$\bigcup_{U\in \mathscr{A}}U = A.$$
