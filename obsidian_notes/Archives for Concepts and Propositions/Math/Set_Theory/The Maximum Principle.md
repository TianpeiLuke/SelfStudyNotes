## Theorem

>[!important]
>**Name**: The Hausdorff's Maximum Principle

>[!important] Theorem
>Let $A$ be a set that is **strictly partially ordered**. 
>
>Then there exists a **maximal simply ordered subset** $B$ of $A$.

>[!info]
>The maximum principle is an early statement similar to **Zorn's lemma**.

- [[Zorn Lemma]]

## Explanation

>[!info]
>Given an order relation $<$ on $A$ such that $<$ admits *nonreflexivity* and *transitivity* properties on $A$, then there exists a subset $B\subset A$ such that  $<$ admits an additional *Comparability* property on $B$, and the following holds  $$\sup B \in B.$$
