## Concept Definition

>[!important]
>**Name**: Dual of Direct Sum

>[!important] Proposition
>If $S$ and $W$ are subspaces of a vector space $V$, and if 
>$$
>V = S \oplus W,
>$$
>then the **dual** of $S$ is **isomorphic** to the **annihilator** of its **complement** $W$, i.e.
>$$
>S^{*} \simeq W^{0}; 
>$$
>and similarly
>$$
>W^{*} \simeq S^{0}.
>$$
>
>And the **dual space** $V^{*}$ has *direct sum decomposition*
>$$
>V^{*} = S^{*} \oplus W^{*} = W^{0} \oplus S^{0}.
