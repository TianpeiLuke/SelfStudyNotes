### **Appropriateness**

**Does this paper fit in AMLC?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = This paper is appropriate to the AMLC audience (most submissions).

### **Type of Contribution**

**Which category does this paper best fit?**

- üí° Discovery = This paper provides insights or proposes a novel ML contribution with potential value to Amazon.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: This paper is fundamentally a diagnostic analysis of a deployed system. Its primary contribution is the insight ("discovery") explaining _why_ the system behaves a certain way, rather than the development or deployment of a new system._

### **Customer Problem**

**Was the Amazon customer problem that this work addresses clearly stated?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper clearly states a customer problem.
    
    - Reviewer's note: The paper correctly identifies the business problem: Mithra, a critical production system for GuardDuty, has a significant false negative problem for certain classes of malicious domains, creating a protection gap for AWS customers.

### **Paper Strengths**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper strengths.**

The paper's primary strength is that it conducts a much-needed deep dive into a known performance issue with a Tier-1 production model at Amazon scale. Instead of simply acknowledging the performance disparity, the authors attempt to provide a data-driven explanation by linking model accuracy to the graph's structural properties. This kind of diagnostic work is valuable, as it moves the conversation from "the model is wrong" to "the model is wrong _because_ of this measurable property."

The most commendable part of this work is the pragmatic approach to measuring homophily. Recognizing that a direct 2-hop neighborhood calculation on a graph of this magnitude is computationally prohibitive, the authors cleverly engineered an approximation using features that were already being generated by the existing Mithra pipeline. This "free" computation makes the analysis practical and immediately usable for monitoring and evaluating label feeds without requiring a costly redesign of the data pipeline. This is a good example of scrappy, impactful science within engineering constraints.

### **Paper Weaknesses**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper weaknesses / areas for improvement.**

From a critical perspective, this paper is long on diagnosis but critically short on prescription. It functions as a detailed problem report but stops just short of offering a meaningful, validated solution.

First, the core "discovery" of the paper‚Äîthat a GNN's performance is correlated with graph homophily‚Äîis a well-established phenomenon in the academic literature. The paper spends a great deal of effort to "demystify" a disparity by confirming that Mithra, like most message-passing GNNs, struggles with heterophilic connections. While valuable as an internal validation, this does not represent a novel scientific contribution. The paper is essentially re-discovering a known limitation of this class of models within the specific context of the DNS graph.

Second, the paper's primary recommendation is to use the homophily metric to evaluate and select label feeds. While sensible, this is a data curation strategy, not a modeling improvement. The analysis does not propose or test any modifications to the Mithra architecture itself that would make it more robust to heterophily. A senior-level contribution would have taken the next step: proposing and testing a GNN architecture designed for heterophily (e.g., by incorporating ego-feature importance, higher-order connections, or non-local message passing) and demonstrating that it closes the performance gap on the low-homophily feeds like ATIG or CrowdStrike. The paper identifies the "what" but completely sidesteps the "how to fix it."

Third, the analysis does not sufficiently disentangle the impact of **extreme class imbalance** from homophily. The benign feeds, which perform well, constitute 96.8% of the labeled data. The poor performance on malicious feeds could be as much a function of the model being overwhelmed by the benign class as it is about the graph structure. The experiment of dropping the Alexa feed is suggestive but not rigorous enough. A more convincing analysis would involve controlled experiments with subsampled benign data to isolate the effect of homophily from the effect of imbalance.

Finally, framing the homophily calculation as a "free" computation is somewhat misleading. It is only free because the team is already paying the cost to compute a complex set of hand-crafted features. This shortcut, while clever, anchors the solution to the existing, heuristic-based architecture and distracts from a more fundamental discussion about what features a pure, end-to-end GNN would need.

### **Customer Problem Importance**

**Is the customer problem that this paper addresses an important problem to solve?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper addresses an important customer problem to solve.
    

---

### **Problem Solution**

**How far did the work go in solving the customer problem?**

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ = The paper provides a partial solution.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The work provides a tool for _understanding_ the problem (the homophily metric) and a strategy for data curation. It does not provide a solution to the core modeling problem of how to accurately classify nodes in low-homophily, imbalanced regions of the graph. It explains the failures but does not fix them._

### **Originality**

**How original is the approach or application?**

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ = Minor improvement.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The application of homophily analysis to this specific production problem is useful, and the feature-based approximation is a clever engineering trick. However, the underlying concept is not new, and the paper does not propose a novel methodology. It is an application of existing graph theory to a production system._

### **Clarity**

**Is the paper well-structured and well-written?**

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ = Understandable by most readers.
    

---

### **Presentation Format**

**If accepted, how should this paper be presented?**

- üñºÔ∏è Poster Presentation
    
    - _Reviewer's note: This work is a valuable internal case study and a good example of deep-dive analysis. It would generate good discussion at a poster session. However, its lack of a novel, validated solution makes it unsuitable for an oral presentation, which should be reserved for work that presents a more complete story from problem to solution._

### **Overall Decision**

**How important is it to accept this paper to AMLC?**

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ = Borderline. Ambivalent.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: I am on the fence. On one hand, it's a great example of the kind of deep-dive diagnostic work that applied scientists should be doing. On the other, it feels incomplete. It presents a strong "Part 1" of a project but is missing "Part 2," where the insights are used to build a better model. I would lean toward acceptance, but with the strong caveat that the authors should be transparent about the limitations and the "next steps" during their presentation._
