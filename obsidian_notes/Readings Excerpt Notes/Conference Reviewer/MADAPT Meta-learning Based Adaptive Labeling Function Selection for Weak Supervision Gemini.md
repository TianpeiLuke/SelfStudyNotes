### **Appropriateness**

**Does this paper fit in AMLC?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = This paper is appropriate to the AMLC audience (most submissions).
    

---

### **Type of Contribution**

**Which category does this paper best fit?**

- üí° Discovery = This paper provides insights or proposes a novel ML contribution with potential value to Amazon.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: While evaluated on a production-relevant dataset (RnR) with significant projected impact, the core contribution is the novel MAD-APT framework itself. It represents a significant methodological advance over existing systems, making it a "Discovery" paper with a clear path to deployment._

### **Customer Problem**

**Was the Amazon customer problem that this work addresses clearly stated?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper clearly states a customer problem.
    
    - Reviewer's note: The paper does an excellent job of articulating the core challenges in Buyer Abuse Prevention (BAP): evolving abuse patterns and, critically, the inconsistent and shifting definitions of abuse across different stakeholders, regions, and services. This problem of managing noisy, conflicting, and low-volume labels is a significant and practical challenge for many applied ML teams at Amazon.

### **Paper Strengths**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper strengths.**

This is an outstanding paper that proposes a novel and elegant solution to a deeply challenging problem in applied machine learning. The primary strength is the **principled fusion of meta-learning and programmatic weak supervision (PWS)**. While PWS frameworks like Snorkel have been valuable, their single-task assumption is a major limitation in complex, real-world domains like abuse detection. MAD-APT directly addresses this by using a meta-learning framework to train a pool of task-specialized Labeling Functions (LFs) that can be adapted and composed for new or low-resource tasks. This is a significant conceptual leap forward.

Another key strength is the **contextual LF retrieval mechanism**. A common failure mode of PWS is noise introduced by irrelevant LFs. MAD-APT's use of a shared task encoder to generate signatures for LFs and then retrieve the top-K most relevant ones based on task affinity is a sophisticated and effective way to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the generated soft labels. The ablation study clearly demonstrates the value of this component, showing a significant reduction in LF conflict rates and a corresponding boost in label accuracy and end-model performance.

Finally, the empirical evaluation is thorough and compelling. The choice of the Abuse Reversal and Reclassification (RnR) dataset, with its 15+ highly imbalanced and semantically distinct sub-tasks, is the perfect testbed for this methodology. The results are impressive, showing a

**16.1% AUC-ROC improvement on emerging abuse types** and a significant overall lift compared to strong baselines like Vanilla and Meta-Snorkel. The demonstrated strength in few-shot adaptation is particularly relevant for the fast-moving abuse space.

### **Paper Weaknesses**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper weaknesses / areas for improvement.**

While the paper is excellent, a few areas could be clarified or strengthened. First, the **complexity of the system** is non-trivial. The framework involves multiple stages: meta-training LFs, constructing signatures, retrieving LFs, learning a label model, and finally training a multi-view end model. A more detailed discussion of the computational cost, training time, and engineering effort required to implement and maintain such a system in production would be valuable for the AMLC audience. For instance, how sensitive is the framework to hyperparameters like the number of adaptation steps (T) or the number of retrieved LFs (K)?

Second, the paper mentions that a high-quality test set was created via in-depth audits using human annotation and LLM prompting. This is a great step, but more detail on this process would increase confidence in the results. For example, what was the inter-annotator agreement for the human labelers? How was the LLM prompt designed to ensure unbiased and accurate labels, and how were its outputs validated? Providing more transparency on the ground-truth label quality would further solidify the impressive reported gains.

Lastly, the customer problem statement briefly touches on a critical point: the framework's reliance on contextual signals "may disadvantage underrepresented groups." This is a crucial consideration for any system deployed at Amazon's scale. While a full fairness audit is likely beyond the scope of a conference paper, expanding this section with a more detailed discussion of the potential fairness risks and proposed mitigation strategies (e.g., specific monitoring mechanisms, methods for auditing LFs for bias) would make the paper even more impactful and responsible.
