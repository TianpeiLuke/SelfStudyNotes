### **Appropriateness**

**Does this paper fit in AMLC?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = This paper is appropriate to the AMLC audience (most submissions).
    

---

### **Type of Contribution**

**Which category does this paper best fit?**

- üí° Discovery = This paper provides insights or proposes a novel ML contribution with potential value to Amazon.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: While the paper analyzes a deployed system (Mithra), its core contribution is the discovery and analysis of the relationship between homophily and performance disparity, which is a novel insight with potential to improve future deployed systems._

### **Customer Problem**

**Was the Amazon customer problem that this work addresses clearly stated?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper clearly states a customer problem.
    
    - Reviewer's note: The paper clearly states that AWS GuardDuty customers need accurate and continuous protection from malicious domains. It identifies the problem that the existing production model, Mithra, has performance disparities and fails to detect some malicious domains (False Negatives), which this work aims to explain and solve.

### **Paper Strengths**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper strengths.**

This paper provides a critical and insightful analysis into the performance limitations of Mithra, a production GNN at an immense scale. The primary strength is the introduction and application of a

**graph structural metric (homophily)** to explain a key business problem: performance disparity between malicious and benign domain detection. Instead of just noting the performance gap, the authors dig into the "why," providing a data-driven explanation rooted in the underlying structure of the DNS graph. This is a great example of deep scientific analysis applied to a real-world production system.

A second major strength is the development of an

**efficient, "free" approximation for the homophily ratio**. Calculating this metric on a graph with billions of nodes and over 200 trillion daily requests is non-trivial. By cleverly leveraging features already generated by the Mithra pipeline, the authors provide a practical way to measure this crucial property without incurring significant additional computational cost. This makes the findings immediately actionable for model monitoring and improvement.

Finally, the paper does an excellent job of connecting the theoretical concept of homophily to concrete business decisions, such as evaluating the quality of third-party label feeds. The analysis showing how dropping certain feeds impacts the overall homophily and model performance provides a clear framework for making data-driven decisions about which label sources to retain, a crucial consideration given the risk of losing a feed like CrowdStrike.

### **Paper Weaknesses**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper weaknesses / areas for improvement.**

While the analysis is strong, the paper could be improved by more explicitly outlining the "so what" of the findings. The conclusion mentions that the analysis can be "leveraged to enhance the existing model," but the paper stops short of proposing or testing specific model enhancements. For instance, could the homophily score be directly incorporated as a feature? Or could it be used to trigger a different, specialized model for low-homophily (heterophilic) subgraphs? Presenting preliminary results from such an experiment would elevate the paper from a "discovery" paper to a "deployed" contribution.

Second, the paper's definition of the homophily metric and its approximations could be clarified. The authors propose a 2-hop extension to the standard homophily definition but the formula provided is a bit dense. A more intuitive, step-by-step explanation or a small, illustrative example graph would help readers better grasp the concept. Similarly, while the motivation for four different approximations is understood, the paper quickly settles on using

Havg‚Äã based on correlation. A brief discussion on why the other approximations might be less effective (e.g.,

Hnumm‚Äãax‚Äã being susceptible to outliers) would add more depth to the analysis.

Lastly, the connection between class imbalance and homophily could be disentangled more carefully. The paper notes that benign feeds have more data (96.8%) and higher homophily. While the experiment of dropping the Alexa feed provides evidence that balancing the data improves performance by increasing malicious domain homophily, it's still hard to isolate the impact of homophily from the raw effect of class imbalance. A more controlled experiment, perhaps by subsampling the benign data to match the size of the malicious data while observing the change in homophily and performance, could further strengthen this conclusion.

### **Customer Problem Importance**

**Is the customer problem that this paper addresses an important problem to solve?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper addresses an important customer problem to solve.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: Improving the accuracy of malicious domain detection is a core mission for AWS Security and directly protects AWS customers from a multitude of threats._
        

---

### **Problem Solution**

**How far did the work go in solving the customer problem?**

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ = The paper is an extension of a solution that already exists.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The paper doesn't propose a new end-to-end solution but provides a deep diagnostic analysis and a new metric to understand and improve an existing, highly critical production system. The solution is the insight itself._
        

---

### **Originality**

**How original is the approach or application?**

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ = Substantially different from existing research.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: While homophily in GNNs is a known area of research, this paper is the first to systematically apply it to diagnose performance issues in a massive-scale, production DNS reputation system. The development of a "free" computational approximation for this metric at AWS scale is a highly original and practical contribution._
        

---

### **Clarity**

**Is the paper well-structured and well-written?**

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ = Understandable by most readers.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The paper is generally well-written. The introduction and problem statement are very clear. Some of the methodological details, particularly around the homophily formula, could be slightly clearer, but the overall message and results are easy to understand._

### **Presentation Format**

**If accepted, how should this paper be presented?**

### **Overall Decision**

**How important is it to accept this paper to AMLC?**

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ = Strong paper, I would like to see it accepted.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: This is a high-quality "lessons from the trenches" paper. It provides valuable insights for anyone operating large-scale GNNs in production. The work is scientifically sound, directly relevant to Amazon, and the findings on evaluating label sources are immediately applicable to many teams._
