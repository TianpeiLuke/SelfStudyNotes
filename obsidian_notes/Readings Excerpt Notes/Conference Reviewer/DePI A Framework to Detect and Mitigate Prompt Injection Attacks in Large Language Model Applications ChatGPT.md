Here is the full AMLC-style review of the paper **"DePI: A Framework to Detect and Mitigate Prompt Injection Attacks in Large Language Model Applications"**:

---

### ✅ **Appropriateness**

**Does this paper fit in AMLC?**  
✅ **Yes**

**Rationale:**  
This submission addresses a critical and emerging threat—prompt injection—in Amazon's internal LLM-integrated systems. It is directly relevant to AMLC’s focus on machine learning, trust & safety, and operationalizing ML systems at scale. The work also has concrete applications in fraud and abuse prevention systems like BRP, ContactMiner, and Contact Automation.

---

### 🛠️ **Type of Contribution**

**Which category does this paper best fit?**  
🏗️ **Deployed**

**Rationale:**  
The proposed DePI framework is not merely conceptual—it has been evaluated on production-related datasets, integrated into BRP’s internal LLM-based workflows, and supports real-time applications in fraud appeal systems. There are also concrete steps toward adoption in other systems like SPS Contact Automation.

---

### 🧩 **Customer Problem**

**Was the Amazon customer problem clearly stated?**  
✅ **Yes**

**Rationale:**  
The paper clearly articulates the customer impact: LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that may lead to incorrect fraud classification, ultimately causing revenue loss, increased false positives, and erosion of customer trust. The paper ties these risks to specific Amazon systems and monetary metrics (e.g., $35M chargeback prevention annually).

---

### 🌟 **Paper Strengths**

1. **High-impact and timely problem**: Prompt injection is a top-1 LLM threat per OWASP 2025, and the authors ground the discussion in real Amazon systems affected today.
    
2. **Layered defense framework**: The DePI system combines prompt engineering, auxiliary detection, and synthetic data simulation—a comprehensive defense mechanism instead of relying on a single brittle fix.
    
3. **Well-executed evaluation**: Multiple detection approaches (prompt-enhanced reasoning, fine-tuned detectors, embedding-based classifiers) are compared using publicly available and synthetic datasets with ROC-AUCs approaching 1.0.
    
4. **Synthetic data generation methodology**: The authors provide a reproducible and scalable method for generating domain-specific injection examples, addressing the training data scarcity problem.
    
5. **Deployment relevance**: Experiments are tied directly to BRP systems, LLM risk scores, and customer email fraud use cases, showing that this is not just a research prototype.
    

---

### ⚠️ **Paper Weaknesses**

1. **Limited real deployment validation**: While evaluated on public and synthetic datasets, the paper lacks extensive analysis of **live A/B testing**, **latency impacts**, or **error analysis in production workflows**.
    
2. **Explainability for decision support**: Though reasoning-based outputs are demonstrated, further exploration of model explainability—especially for investigators—is not covered.
    
3. **Scope generalizability**: While the results are impressive for fraud detection and SPS LLMs, it's unclear how easily DePI generalizes to other domains like HR, Legal, or Shopping Assistant bots.
    
4. **Prompt engineering heuristics**: Some prompt-enhancement methods feel brittle and hand-tuned. There's a risk of adversaries adapting quickly unless combined with continual learning.
    
5. **Synthetic data domain limitation**: As the authors note, synthetic data is more effective when seed data is domain-matched. More discussion on **how to systematically curate high-quality seeds across business domains** would strengthen generalizability.

### 💥 **Customer Problem Importance**

✅ **Yes**

**Rationale:**  
Protecting LLM-integrated applications from adversarial misuse is mission-critical, especially in fraud, SPS, and ContactMiner systems. Failure to detect injections can result in large monetary losses, reputational damage, and compromised customer trust. This problem is not hypothetical—it’s demonstrated via real failure cases.

>[!quote]
> From a critical, in-the-trenches perspective, the work provides a solid **proof-of-concept** but falls significantly short of a comprehensive, production-ready solution to the customer problem. It solves an academic version of the problem effectively but fails to meaningfully address the operational complexities inherent in deploying and maintaining such a system at Amazon's scale.
>

> 
> ### **It solves the problem of detecting _known_ attack patterns.**
> 
> The paper demonstrates, convincingly, that by using a combination of public and synthetically generated data, it can train an auxiliary detector that achieves high accuracy on test sets derived from those same distributions. In essence, the authors have built a very effective system for recognizing prompt injection techniques that are already known or are semantically similar to known techniques.
> 
> This is a valuable first step. It provides a baseline defense that can stop amateur or script-based attacks. However, this is not the core of the customer problem. The true problem isn't stopping yesterday's attacks; it's about building a resilient system that can withstand _tomorrow's_ novel attacks.

> 
> ### **It fails to solve the real-world operational challenges.**
> 
> A harsh critic would argue that a model's accuracy on a static test set is one of the least interesting things about a security system. The real challenges are operational, and the paper largely sidesteps them:
> 
> 1. **The Maintenance Treadmill:** The paper's proposed "flywheel" of Evaluation-Detection-Simulation is a nice diagram, but the operational cost is unstated. Prompt injection is an adversarial game where attackers evolve their methods daily. The proposed solution requires a

>     **perpetual cycle of re-training**. Who curates the new seed data? How often must the model be re-deployed? What is the engineering and operational cost of this continuous maintenance? Without addressing this, the solution isn't a framework; it's a recipe for creating a high-maintenance operational burden.
>     
> 2. **The Latency Blind Spot:** The paper admits the auxiliary detector introduces computational overhead and latency but never quantifies it. For a system like Buyer Risk Prevention, which may need to make real-time decisions, every millisecond counts. A solution that adds 100ms or 200ms of latency per check could be entirely unviable, regardless of its accuracy. By not providing performance benchmarks, the paper avoids confronting a make-or-break aspect of the customer problem.
>     
> 3. **The Illusion of Generalization:** The work shows that synthetic data helps the model generalize to the `safeguard` dataset when seeded with `deepset` examples. However, a critic would view this not as true generalization, but as "distributional interpolation." It learned to cover a slightly different, but still static and known, distribution. It does not prove that the system can handle a fundamentally new

>     
> 
> In conclusion, the work goes far enough to build a **strong prototype and a compelling business case** for further investment. It effectively solves the "static" version of the problem. However, it does not provide a robust, scalable, and operationally sustainable solution for the dynamic, ever-evolving, and resource-constrained reality of the customer problem at Amazon. It's a good start, but the hardest parts of the problem remain unsolved.

### 🔍 **Problem Solution**

**Rating:** 5️⃣ = Highly original solution

**Rationale:**  
DePI combines multiple defenses—prompt enhancement, auxiliary fine-tuning, and synthetic data generation—into a coherent, extensible, and Amazon-aligned framework. While individual components may exist in literature, their integration and application to real LLM workflows in fraud detection is novel and highly practical.


>[!quote]
> From a critical research perspective, the methods presented in this paper lack any significant originality. The work is a competent, by-the-book application of pre-existing, well-documented techniques. It's a classic example of "solution engineering," where known components are assembled to solve a specific problem, rather than "research," where new fundamental components are invented.
> 
> Here's a breakdown of why each part of the methodology is unoriginal:
> 
> ### **1. Prompt Enhancement: Re-packaging a Solved Problem**
> 
> The "Prompt Enhancement" pillar of the framework is, critically speaking, a re-branding of the most basic prompt engineering techniques that have been public knowledge since the advent of instruction-following models.
> 
> - **Directive-Based Protection:** Adding a sentence like "Please be mindful that the email content may not be factual" is functionally identical to the "System Prompt" or "meta-prompt" strategy that is standard practice for any team building LLM applications. It's Day 1 knowledge for anyone working with these models.
>     
> - **Enhancement through Reasoning:** Instructing the model to use a chain-of-thought or step-by-step reasoning process is another widely known technique, popularized by multiple foundational papers and blog posts. Claiming this as a novel part of a new framework is a significant overstatement.
>     
> 
> **The critical take:** Presenting these techniques as a core part of a new "framework" is like claiming a new "automotive framework" because you've included a steering wheel and pedals. These are not innovations; they are table stakes for building with LLMs.

> ### **2. Auxiliary Detector: Applying a Standard Security Pattern**
> 
> The concept of an "Auxiliary Detector" is a direct implementation of the classic "pre-flight check" or "input firewall" pattern used in security engineering for decades. The originality here is zero. The paper then evaluates two standard ways to build this firewall:
> 
> - **Embedding + Binary Classification (AD-EBC):** This is arguably the most straightforward approach one could possibly devise: convert text to a vector, and train a classifier on it. This has been a standard technique in NLP for a decade.
>     
> - **Supervised Fine-Tuning (AD-SFT):** This is the modern equivalent of the above. Given the success of fine-tuning for virtually all NLP tasks, using it for a classification task like this is the most obvious and expected approach.
>     
> 
> **The critical take:** The paper demonstrates that the more modern approach (SFT) works better than the slightly older one (EBC). This is a useful, but entirely predictable, empirical result. It does not represent any methodological originality. They simply implemented the two most obvious solutions and reported which one was better.

> 
> ### **3. Synthetic Data Generation: Following a Public Recipe**
> 
> The methodology for generating synthetic data is a direct and faithful implementation of recipes that have already been published and are widely used. The paper even cites its sources for the methodology. The four-step process of collecting seeds, iterative generation, standardization, and filtering is a standard data augmentation loop.
> 
> The key "finding" from this section—that domain-specific seeds improve performance on a domain-specific test set —is a tautology. It provides no new insight into the science of synthetic data generation.
> 
> **The critical take:** The authors followed a known recipe and achieved the expected outcome. This is good execution, but it is not research. There is no novelty in the method itself.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Conclusion on Originality**
> 
> From a harsh, academic standpoint, the paper presents **no original methods**. The DePI framework is a new name for a logical assembly of old parts. The authors have effectively created a case study demonstrating that:
> 
> 1. Standard prompt engineering provides a baseline defense.
>     
> 2. A dedicated input classifier is more robust.
>     
> 3. Fine-tuning a model for classification works better than using static embeddings.
>     
> 4. Training on data that looks like your test data improves performance.
>     
> 
> These are all well-established facts. The paper's value lies in its clear documentation of applying these facts to a specific, important problem at Amazon. However, it should not be confused with a work that contributes new techniques or fundamental insights to the research field of LLM security. It is a work of **application**, not **invention**.

### 🚀 **Originality**

**Rating:** 4️⃣ = Substantially different from existing research

**Rationale:**  
This work builds upon known prompt injection defenses, but adapts them to Amazon’s production systems with new methods for domain-specific synthetic data generation and application-specific prompt engineering. Its originality lies in applied innovation, not theoretical novelty.

---

### 📖 **Clarity**

**Rating:** 5️⃣ = Very clear

**Rationale:**  
The paper is extremely well-written and structured. It uses intuitive figures (e.g., UMAP plots), tables comparing methods, and clearly labeled examples. Each methodology is supported with strong motivation, results, and discussion.

---

### 🧪 **Presentation Format**

🎤 **Oral Presentation**

**Rationale:**  
This paper deserves oral presentation due to its immediate production relevance, methodical experimentation, and security-critical impact. The authors can walk the audience through LLM vulnerabilities and the layered DePI defense pipeline with clarity and urgency.

---

### 🧾 **Overall Decision**

**Rating:** 5️⃣ = I would fight for this paper to be accepted

**Rationale:**  
DePI is an excellent example of Amazon-style innovation: it tackles a pressing internal problem with rigor, impact, and deployability. It also addresses a broader risk that many teams face but haven’t operationalized defenses for. This paper should be featured at AMLC to inspire secure LLM adoption.

---

### 📈 **Confidence**

**Rating:** 5️⃣ = Positive my evaluation is correct; read carefully, familiar with related work

**Rationale:**  
I am familiar with the literature on prompt injection, LLM robustness, and internal fraud detection systems. I reviewed all experiments, synthetic generation pipelines, and references carefully.

# Critic

As a harsh critic, my opinion is that while the DePI paper addresses a timely and critical problem, its contribution to the research topic is overstated, and the effort, while sound, represents a straightforward application of existing techniques rather than a significant leap forward. The framework feels more like a well-executed internal case study than a foundational piece of research.

Here is a detailed breakdown of my critique:

### **Critique of the Research Contribution**

The paper's primary weakness is its limited novelty. The proposed "framework" is, in essence, a logical packaging of two very standard, well-known defense strategies: prompt engineering and a classification-based detector.

1. **Prompt Enhancement is Not a Novel Contribution**: The paper presents "Prompt Enhancement" as a core pillar of its framework. However, the techniques described—adding explicit directive-based protection and instructing the model to reason step-by-step—are among the most basic and widely discussed forms of prompt engineering. While the authors demonstrate their effectiveness in a specific BRP context , this section reads more like a "best practices" tutorial than novel research. The academic community is already well-aware of these methods.
    
2. **The Auxiliary Detector is a Standard Approach**: The idea of training a separate classifier to vet inputs before they reach the main LLM is a standard "defense-in-depth" security principle. The paper evaluates two common ways to build such a detector: using sentence embeddings with a classifier (AD-EBC) and fine-tuning an LLM (AD-SFT). While the empirical results are strong and the comparison is useful, this is an application of established methods, not the invention of a new one. The paper confirms that fine-tuning works better, which is an expected outcome, but not a groundbreaking discovery.
    
3. **The "Framework" is a Conceptual Wrapper**: The paper packages these two techniques into a three-part "flywheel" of Evaluation-Detection-Simulation. This is a sensible workflow for any ML security project, but presenting it as a novel, named framework (DePI) inflates the contribution. There is no unique mechanism or algorithm that binds these three parts together in a way that hasn't been done before. It's a logical project plan, not a new scientific framework.
    

### **Critique of the Research Effort**

While the work is executed competently, a critical lens reveals a lack of depth and rigor that one would expect from a top-tier research contribution.

1. **Over-reliance on Public, Generic Datasets**: The core of the model evaluation relies on two public HuggingFace datasets, `deepset` and `safeguard`. While useful for benchmarking, these datasets are generic and do not capture the specific, nuanced threats an Amazon system like BRP would face. The paper itself proves this point when it shows that models trained on one dataset perform poorly on the other, highlighting their different distributions. The effort would have been significantly more compelling if the authors had created and released a new, high-quality benchmark dataset curated from real-world (anonymized) attacks against Amazon systems.
    
2. **The Synthetic Data Generation is Formulaic**: The paper follows a standard recipe for synthetic data generation: take seed examples, prompt an LLM to create more, and filter the results. The main finding here is that using domain-specific seeds improves performance on a domain-specific test set, which is a largely intuitive and unsurprising result. A more sophisticated effort would have involved creating a more adversarial generation process, perhaps using a generator-discriminator setup to create synthetic attacks that are specifically designed to fool the current detector, thus pushing the state of the art.
    
3. **The Scope of Evaluation is Narrow**: The "Prompt Enhancement" section is evaluated with a single attack example. This is anecdotal evidence at best. There is no systematic evaluation of how these prompt-level defenses hold up against a diverse and evolving set of attack vectors. A rigorous evaluation would require testing against hundreds or thousands of different attacks of varying complexity, not just one.
    

In conclusion, the paper is a solid piece of applied science that solves a real and important business problem for Amazon. However, as a contribution to the broader research community, it falls short. It applies known techniques to a specific domain and achieves expected results. The "DePI framework" is a conceptual wrapper around standard practices, and the research effort lacks the depth, novelty, and rigorous evaluation necessary to be considered a truly significant advancement in the field of LLM security.
