### **Paper Strengths**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper strengths.**

This is a strong paper that presents a well-designed and empirically validated solution to a significant business problem. The primary strength lies in the novel

**TREND architecture**, a sophisticated multimodal fusion framework that effectively integrates tabular, textual/sequential, and graph-based data. The use of self-attention for intra-modality refinement and cross-attention for inter-modality interaction is a principled approach that captures complex, complementary abuse signals that are often missed by single-modality models.

Another key strength is the methodical approach to leveraging unstructured text and sequential data. The development of a

**custom, domain-specific tokenizer** is a crucial contribution, and the authors clearly demonstrate its value over general-purpose tokenizers, showing a tangible lift in performance and better preservation of semantic integrity for domain-specific terms.

Finally, the paper's empirical evaluation is comprehensive and convincing. The authors not only show significant performance lifts over existing production models (a 4.5% and 6.2% lift in PR-AUC over tree and graph-based models, respectively) but also conduct a thorough

**ablation study** that isolates the contribution of each component of the TREND architecture (Self-Attention, Cross-Attention, and Adaptive Weighting). The inclusion of results from a deployed system, which resulted in a

**4% reduction in concession losses**, provides powerful evidence of the work's real-world impact and value.

### **Paper Weaknesses**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper weaknesses / areas for improvement.**

While the paper is strong overall, there are a few areas that could be improved. First, the **novelty of the Adaptive Weighting network** could be further clarified. While the paper cites an existing source, a more detailed explanation of how this mechanism is adapted for the specific challenge of abuse detection with potentially missing or noisy modalities would strengthen the contribution. For instance, providing a more intuitive explanation or visualization of how the weights shift in response to different abuse scenarios (e.g., hit-and-run vs. repeat offender) would be beneficial.

Second, the **qualitative analysis**, while insightful, feels somewhat limited. The paper presents one cohort of abusive accounts identified by TREND but missed by baselines. Expanding this section with a broader typology of newly discovered abuse patterns, perhaps with visualizations of the attention weights, would provide deeper insight into

_why_ the model is effective and enhance the planned future work on explainability.

Finally, the rationale for choosing GPT-2, while justified by latency constraints, could be expanded slightly. A brief discussion on whether any architectural modifications to larger models (e.g., knowledge distillation, quantization) were considered as an alternative to using a smaller model from the outset would add completeness to the analysis.

### **Customer Problem Importance**

**Is the customer problem that this paper addresses an important problem to solve?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper addresses an important customer problem to solve. Minimizing losses from refund abuse is a direct, high-value problem for any e-commerce marketplace.

### **Problem Solution**

**How far did the work go in solving the customer problem?**

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ = The paper provides a solution that is substantially different from an existing solution. The work presents a novel, multi-modal architecture that outperforms existing single-modality production systems and has been successfully deployed, demonstrably reducing financial losses.
    

---

### **Originality**

**How original is the approach or application?**

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ = Substantially different from existing research. While multimodal fusion using transformers is an active area of research, the application of a dual attention mechanism (self and cross) combined with adaptive weighting specifically for fusing tabular, text, and graph data in the fraud domain is a novel and significant contribution.

### **Clarity**

**Is the paper well-structured and well-written?**

- 5Ô∏è‚É£ = Very clear. The paper is exceptionally well-written and structured. The methodology is explained clearly with helpful diagrams (Figures 1, 3) and algorithms (Algorithm 1). The experimental results are presented logically and are easy to follow.

### **Overall Decision**

**How important is it to accept this paper to AMLC?**

- 5Ô∏è‚É£ = I would fight for this paper to be accepted. The paper addresses a critical business problem with a novel, well-engineered solution. The results are strong, the analysis is thorough, and the work has already demonstrated significant real-world impact. It is an exemplary applied science paper that would be of high interest to the AMLC community.
