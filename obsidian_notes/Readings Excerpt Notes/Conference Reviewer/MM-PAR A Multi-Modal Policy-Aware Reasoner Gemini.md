Here is a detailed review of the AMLC submission "MM-PAR: A Multi-Modal Policy-Aware Reasoner," written from the perspective of a harsh, critical senior applied scientist.

### **Appropriateness**

**Does this paper fit in AMLC?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = This paper is appropriate to the AMLC audience (most submissions).
    

---

### **Type of Contribution**

**Which category does this paper best fit?**

- üí° Discovery = This paper provides insights or proposes a novel ML contribution with potential value to Amazon.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: Although the system shows promising results for a production problem, its core contributions‚Äîa specific MoE architecture, the application of GRPO, and the novel "policy innovation" task‚Äîare methodological proposals. It's a discovery paper that outlines a potential path to a deployed system._

### **Customer Problem**

**Was the Amazon customer problem that this work addresses clearly stated?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper clearly states a customer problem.
    
    - Reviewer's note: The paper does an excellent job detailing the four key challenges for Abuse Prevention (AP): complex policy evaluation across modalities, lack of model explainability, high maintenance overhead, and a slow, manual policy evolution cycle. This is a clear and accurate representation of the real-world operational problems.

### **Paper Strengths**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper strengths.**

This is an ambitious paper that tackles a multifaceted and critical business problem: moving beyond simple "accept/reject" decisions to create a system that can reason, justify, and even help innovate on the policies that govern its decisions. The primary strength of this work is its forward-looking vision. The proposal to use LLMs not just for decision-making but for "policy innovation" through backward reasoning is a genuinely novel concept in the abuse prevention space and has the potential to be a game-changer if realized.

The paper's methodological approach to handling multimodality is also a notable strength. The authors correctly identify that simply ingesting tabular data is insufficient and that a true policy reasoner must jointly understand text, images (of policies and products), and structured data. The decision to build upon a Vision-Language Model (VLM) backbone and augment it with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) projector to fuse additional modalities is a sound and modern architectural choice.

Finally, the results, particularly the 20.5% accuracy lift over the production model, are substantial and demonstrate the clear potential of this approach. The high performance in the justification task (84.1% accuracy) is also impressive and directly addresses the critical business need for explainability.

### **Paper Weaknesses**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper weaknesses / areas for improvement.**

While the paper's ambition is a strength, it is also its greatest weakness. The work attempts to solve too many hard problems at once, and as a result, the methodology and evaluation for each part feel rushed and lack depth.

First, the claims of novelty around the architecture are overstated. The use of a ViT+LLM backbone is standard for VLMs, and adding an MoE layer for multimodal fusion is a known technique. The paper presents this as a novel design ("MM-PAR") but does not sufficiently differentiate it from existing multimodal fusion architectures. The core contribution seems to be the

_application_ of these techniques, not the invention of them.

Second, the "policy innovation" component, while being the most exciting idea, is also the most poorly evaluated. The paper claims 75% "coverage" by identifying 4 out of 5 predefined opportunities and a 0.127% "accuracy." These metrics are confusing and feel post-hoc. What does "coverage" mean in a real-world setting with hundreds of potential policy gaps? How was the "accuracy" of finding a new opportunity validated? This evaluation is anecdotal and does not provide convincing evidence that the model has a generalizable capability for policy discovery. It feels more like a carefully engineered demo than a robust scientific result.

Third, the training and evaluation methodology raises serious questions about practicality and cost. The framework requires Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then complex Reinforcement Learning post-training (Dr.GRPO). This is a heavyweight, expensive, and difficult-to-reproduce training pipeline. The authors mention using 2 g5.48xlarge nodes, but do not provide total training time or CO2/dollar cost. Furthermore, the reliance on a complex, rule-based reward model for RL creates a new kind of technical debt and maintenance burden, undercutting the claim of reducing operational overhead.

Finally, the paper makes bold claims about being a "lightweight design" that enables "local training and deployment" with "low cost." This is hard to reconcile with a system that requires multi-node training on high-end GPUs and a complex RL pipeline. A critical reader is left skeptical of the true operational cost and feasibility of deploying such a system widely across Amazon.

### **Customer Problem Importance**

**Is the customer problem that this paper addresses an important problem to solve?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper addresses an important customer problem to solve.
    

---

### **Problem Solution**

**How far did the work go in solving the customer problem?**

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ = The paper provides a partial solution.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The work provides a strong solution for the decision-making and justification tasks. However, the "policy innovation" solution is not convincingly demonstrated. Furthermore, the proposed solution appears to replace one form of operational overhead (model refreshes) with another, arguably more complex one (a multi-stage SFT+RL training pipeline)._

### **Originality**

**How original is the approach or application?**

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ = Notable extension of existing work.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The core architectural components (VLM, MoE, GRPO) are not new. The originality lies in (1) combining these components in this specific way for abuse prevention, and (2) the novel framing of the "policy innovation" task for an LLM, even if the evaluation of it is weak. This is a notable extension of what is typically asked of a fraud detection model._
        

---

### **Clarity**

**Is the paper well-structured and well-written?**

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ = Understandable by most readers.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The paper is generally well-written, but the explanation of the "policy innovation" task and its evaluation metrics could be much clearer._
        

---

### **Presentation Format**

**If accepted, how should this paper be presented?**

- üé§ Oral Presentation
    
    - _Reviewer's note: Despite its flaws, the paper is ambitious and tackles a forward-looking problem. The reported 20.5% accuracy lift and the novel concept of AI-driven policy innovation are significant enough to warrant an oral presentation to stimulate discussion, even if the work is not yet fully mature._

### **Overall Decision**

**How important is it to accept this paper to AMLC?**

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ = Strong paper, I would like to see it accepted.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: This paper, while critically flawed in its claims of simplicity and the evaluation of its most ambitious goal, is a strong, thought-provoking submission. It pushes the boundary of what we expect from an abuse prevention system. The impressive accuracy on the core tasks and the novelty of the problem framing make it a paper I would like to see at AMLC, as it will spark important conversations about the future of AI in risk management._

### **Confidence**

**How confident are you in your review?**

- 5Ô∏è‚É£ = Positive my evaluation is correct; read carefully, familiar with related work.
