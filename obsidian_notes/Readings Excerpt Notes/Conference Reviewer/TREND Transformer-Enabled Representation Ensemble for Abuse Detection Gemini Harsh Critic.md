Here is a detailed review of the AMLC submission "TREND: Transformer-Enabled Representation Ensemble for Abuse Detection," written from the perspective of a harsh, critical senior applied scientist.

### **Appropriateness**

**Does this paper fit in AMLC?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = This paper is appropriate to the AMLC audience (most submissions).
    

---

### **Type of Contribution**

**Which category does this paper best fit?**

- üèóÔ∏è Deployed = This paper describes contributions in a deployed system.
    

---

### **Customer Problem**

**Was the Amazon customer problem that this work addresses clearly stated?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper clearly states a customer problem.
    
    - Reviewer's note: The paper clearly identifies the problem of "hit-and-run" concession abuse and the limitations of existing single-modality models in detecting sophisticated, coordinated attacks, which is a well-defined and important problem for Amazon.

### **Paper Strengths**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper strengths.**

The primary strength of this paper is its clear focus on a high-value, practical business problem and the successful deployment of an end-to-end system that demonstrates a tangible impact on concession losses. The authors do a good job of articulating the limitations of existing tabular and graph-only models, motivating the need for a multimodal approach that incorporates rich textual and sequential signals, which have been historically underutilized.

The empirical evaluation is methodologically sound, with a clear ablation study that attempts to justify the architectural choices. The reported 4.5% and 6.2% lift in PR-AUC over production baselines is a non-trivial improvement, and the 4% reduction in concession losses for a marketplace is a meaningful business outcome that makes this work relevant to the AMLC audience. The effort to build a custom tokenizer to handle domain-specific vocabulary is also a commendable and necessary step for handling real-world operational data.

### **Paper Weaknesses**

**Please provide feedback to the authors on the paper weaknesses / areas for improvement.**

While the paper presents a successful engineering outcome, it suffers from a lack of scientific rigor and an overstatement of its novelty. A critical review reveals several key weaknesses:

First, the **originality of the TREND architecture is questionable**. The architecture is presented as novel, but it is fundamentally a standard implementation of a multimodal transformer that uses self-attention for intra-modal encoding and cross-attention for inter-modal fusion. These are well-established patterns in the multimodal literature. The paper fails to differentiate TREND from existing architectures beyond its specific application to abuse detection. The "Adaptive Weighting" component, which is the most interesting part, provides only a marginal 0.3% PR-AUC lift over the SA+CA model (from 37.9% to 38.2%), a gain that is likely not statistically significant and feels tacked on.

Second, the **evaluation of the custom tokenizer is incomplete**. The authors show that their tokenizer performs better than generic ones when used with a GPT-2 model. However, they fail to complete the analysis by showing the performance of the final, complete TREND model with a

_standard_ tokenizer. Without this comparison, it's impossible to know how much of the final 4.5% lift comes from the sophisticated fusion architecture and how much is simply due to better tokenization. It's plausible that a large portion of the gains could have been realized by simply improving the tokenizer for the existing production models.

Third, the paper **completely omits any discussion of latency and computational cost**. For a deployed system at Amazon scale, this is a critical failure. The authors state they chose a lightweight language model due to a "p99 limit of 2000 milliseconds," but they provide no data on the actual p99 latency of the final TREND model. A complex, multi-modal fusion architecture with multiple attention blocks is computationally expensive. Without latency and cost benchmarks, the claimed business impact is unverifiable; a model that is too slow or too expensive to run in production is not a viable solution, regardless of its offline accuracy.

Finally, the **qualitative analysis is anecdotal and lacks depth**. It highlights a single cohort of abusive accounts found by the model. This is not a rigorous analysis. A proper qualitative study would involve a much larger sample of cases, categorize the types of new patterns discovered, and ideally use attention visualization (as noted in the future work) to explain

_why_ the model made its decisions.

### **Customer Problem Importance**

**Is the customer problem that this paper addresses an important problem to solve?**

- ‚úÖ Yes = The paper addresses an important customer problem to solve.
    

---

### **Problem Solution**

**How far did the work go in solving the customer problem?**

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ = The paper is an extension of a solution that already exists.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The paper successfully implements a more complex model that outperforms existing ones on offline metrics. However, by failing to address latency and cost, it doesn't fully solve the _production_ problem. It provides an effective model but not necessarily a practical, deployable system._
        

---

### **Originality**

**How original is the approach or application?**

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ = Minor improvement.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The approach consists of assembling well-known components (BPE tokenizers, self-attention, cross-attention) into a standard multimodal architecture. The application to abuse detection is valuable, but the methodology itself is an incremental application of existing research, not a significant step forward._
        

---

### **Clarity**

**Is the paper well-structured and well-written?**

- 5Ô∏è‚É£ = Very clear.
    

---

### **Presentation Format**

**If accepted, how should this paper be presented?**

- üñºÔ∏è Poster Presentation
    
    - _Reviewer's note: While the business impact is good, the lack of methodological novelty and the critical omission of performance/cost analysis make an oral presentation inappropriate. A poster would allow the authors to discuss the practical engineering challenges and business impact with interested parties._
        

---

### **Overall Decision**

**How important is it to accept this paper to AMLC?**

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ = Borderline. Ambivalent.
    
    - _Reviewer's note: The paper reports a solid engineering achievement with business impact, which is valuable for AMLC. However, the work is presented as a novel research contribution, which it is not. The lack of latency/cost analysis is a major flaw for a paper about a deployed system. I am ambivalent but would lean toward acceptance if the authors can add performance benchmarks and tone down the claims of architectural novelty during the presentation._

### **Confidence**

**How confident are you in your review?**

- 5Ô∏è‚É£ = Positive my evaluation is correct; read carefully, familiar with related work.
