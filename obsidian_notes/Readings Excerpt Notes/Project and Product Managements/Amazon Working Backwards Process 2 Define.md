>**Working Backwards involves five stages:** Listen, Define, Invent, Refine, and Test & Iterate. Each stage aligns to the Customer Questions and a set of recommended actions. Discover the definitions, importance, and what to do in each stage below.

## Define

>[!question]
>_**What is the prevailing customer problem/opportunity?** What data informed this?_

- This stage is in *Problem Space*.
- Similar to [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.2 Customer Needs]]
- We need to identify underserved customer needs
- We need to group customer needs into must-haves, performance, and delighters
- This part discuss on how to use data analytics to support the claim

### **What is the Define stage?**

>[!quote]
>After listening to your customer and understanding their perspective, you will move to the Define stage. In the Define stage, we *synthesize* information and customer data into **trends**, and *identify the key problem or opportunity* to solve.  
>
>Having a clearly defined **focus** will set you up for success later in the Working Backwards process, especially as you start writing your document.

### **How do you take action in the Define stage?**

- An output of the Define stage is a concise, clear **Problem/ Opportunity statement**. Use this fill-in-the-blank template to create one.

` “Today, [customers] have to [problem/opportunity] when [situation]. Customers need a way to [insert need].”`

- Check similarity to the **User Story** in Agile. 
- [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.2 Customer Needs]]

>[!quote]
> A strong problem or opportunity statement is data-driven. Data on the customer problem or opportunity comes in many forms, including behavioral metrics, qualitative data, and subjective metrics. All of this data will help you synthesize the top trends into your problem/opportunity statement.
> 
> - **Behavioral Metrics** - Quantitative measures of **what customers are doing** with current products or experiences, which you can measure at scale or collect through direct observation
>     
> - **Qualitative Data** - Includes **verbal feedback** from customers that is critical to understanding why a customer is doing what they do, as well as qualitative observations of what they are doing and how they are doing it.
>     
> - **Subjective Metrics** - Quantitative measures of the subjective customer experience that can be assessed with any closed-ended rating scales or existing standardized instruments

Personas are **distilled essences of real users**. In user experience (UX) design, you **use personas to build empathy with target users and focus on their world**. You should **always create personas from** _observations_ about real users, personas should never be invented out of your assumptions about your users.” Beware of shortcuts and creating stereotypes while building personas - specificity matters. |
