# **What is Working Backwards?** 

>[!quote]
>Working Backwards is **Amazon’s process of discovery and invention that delivers customer delight**. Working Backwards is how we stay customer obsessed — we work backwards from the moment that the product, service or experience is in a customer’s hands. The Working Backwards framework can be used for big and small inventions alike, and for external or internal customers.

## **Working Backwards Principles**

>[!quote]
> These three Working Backwards principles ensure that we stay true to our practice of Customer Obsession.
> 
> - **Principle #1:** Working Backwards applies to all of our customers, so we *listen to diverse customer perspectives* and *actively include* them in the process.
> - **Principle #2:** We stay laser-focused on the customer opportunity, but are flexible in how we solve it.
> - **Principle #3:** Working Backwards is a team effort, and we all share the responsibility for speaking up on behalf of the customer.

## Process

>[!quote]
>**Working Backwards involves five stages:** Listen, Define, Invent, Refine, and Test & Iterate. Each stage aligns to the Customer Questions and a set of recommended actions. Discover the definitions, importance, and what to do in each stage below.

>**Working Backwards involves five stages:**
>
> - [Stage 1: Listen](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/WorkingBackwards/Process/#HWorkingBackwardsStage1:Listen). Who is the customer and what insights do we have about them? 
> 
> - [Stage 2: Define](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/WorkingBackwards/Process/#HWorkingBackwardsStage2:Define). What is the prevailing customer problem/opportunity? What data informed this? 
> 
> - [Stage 3: Invent.](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/WorkingBackwards/Process/#HWorkingBackwardsStage3:Invent) What is the solution? Why is it the right solution to address the customer need versus other alternatives?
> 
> - [Stage 4: Refine.](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/WorkingBackwards/Process/#HWorkingBackwardsStage4:Refine) How would we describe the end-to-end customer experience? What is the most important customer benefit?
> 
> - [Stage 5: Test & Iterate](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/WorkingBackwards/Process/#HWorkingBackwardsStage5:Test26Iterate). How will we define and measure success?

### Compare with Lean Product Process

>[!info]
>Compare with **Lean Product Process**: [[The Lean Product Playbook Book Summary]]
>- Stage 1:  Determine Your Target Customer
>- Stage 2: Identify Underserved Customer Needs
>- Stage 3: Define Your Value Proposition
>- Stage 4: Specify Your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Feature Set
>- Stage 5: Create Your MVP Prototype (including UX Design)
>- Stage 6: Test Your MVP with Customers
>
>Stage 1 to 4 in WB process correspond to the Stage 1 to 3 in Lean Product Process.
