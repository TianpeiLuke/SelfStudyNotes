## Listen

>[!question]
>Who is the customer and what insights do we have about them?

- This stage is in *Problem Space*.
- Similar to [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.1 Target Customer]]
- We need to define target customer
- We can segment the customer into categories
- We can use the Customer Persona
- This part emphasize that we need to listen to voice of customer by direct interview, customer contact collection etc.
- Connection to **Voice of Customer** projects

### **What is the Listen stage?** 

>[!quote]
>To work backwards from the customer, we need to get to know them. This includes all types of customers: retail customers, third-party sellers, advertisers, AWS customers, internal customers, etc. The *goal* of the Listen stage is to **learn as much about the customer as possible**. Who is your customer and what do you know about them? Actions in the Listen stage include *talking directly to customers*, *seeking out customer feedback and anecdotes*, *analyzing customer data*, and/or working with UX Design and User Research teams to *gather customer insights*.


### **How do you take action in the Listen stage?**

>[!quote]
>Below are recommended actions to take in this stage. Note: While these resources and tools are focused on listening to external customers, you can easily apply the same concepts to internal customers by scheduling a Gemba walk, conducting an internal survey, or scheduling a focus group with internal users.

| [Empathy Mapping](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/ShoppingDesign/ConceptLab/New_Idea_Cookbook/Align_vision_for_customers/#HRecipe232:Empathymapping) | An empathy map is a collaborative visualization used to articulate what we know about a particular type of user.
