## Refine

>[!question]
>_**How would we describe the end-to-end customer experience? What is the most important customer benefit?**_

- This stage is back to *Problem Space*.
- We need to describe customer experience. This is in [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.2 Customer Needs]]
- We need to *identify* the most important customer benefits to address in our product. This is a prioritization process that can be seen in [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.3 Value Proposition]]
- We also discuss how our product deliver the benefits and prioritize those feature sets that most fit customer needs. Similar topic shown in [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.4 MVP Feature Sets]]
- This stage involve writing PR/FAQ doc to communicate with others the benefit of the product and the customer experience it will bring. 

### **What is the Refine stage?**

>[!quote]
>Once you have a solution in mind, it’s time to get crystal clear on *how your idea actually work*. What’s your ‘elevator pitch’? How would you describe your idea in 30 seconds or less? Next, start articulating *how the experience will actually unfold for the customer*. What does it look like or feel like for the customer to engage with your product, service, or experience? What is the most important customer benefit? Document this and increase the clarity of your idea by going through the process of [writing a PR/FAQ](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/WorkingBackwards/PRFAQ) and [creating visuals.](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/WorkingBackwards/PRFAQ/Visuals)
