>**Working Backwards involves five stages:** Listen, Define, Invent, Refine, and Test & Iterate. Each stage aligns to the Customer Questions and a set of recommended actions. Discover the definitions, importance, and what to do in each stage below.

## **Test & Iterate**

>[!question]
>_**How will we define and measure success?**_

- This stage is in *Solution Space*.
- This stage covers mainly on how to test our product. 
- We need to define metrics when we test our product and their features. [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.5 MVP Testing]]
- We also need to test our product to real customer and collect their feedbacks. This stage coincides mostly with [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.6 Test Hypotheses]]

### **What is the Test & Iterate stage?**

>[!quote]
>The Working Backwards process *doesn’t end with developing an idea*. Working Backwards thrives on **continuous iteration**. What needs to happen to actually **launch your idea** and **deliver customer delight**? How will you find out what customers actually like or don’t like about your idea? Actions in this stage include *defining what success looks like*, determining what success metrics you will use, testing, experimenting, and incorporating customer feedback.

### **How do you take action in the Test & Iterate stage?**

| **Evaluate the Customer Experience (CX) against the CX Launch Lovability Scorecard** | [CX Launch Lovability Scorecard](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/WorkingBackwards/Scorecards/#cxscorecard)                                                 | The scorecard gives teams a framework for evaluating the lovability of the CX to ensure we keep a high bar for customers. The goal is to create a lovable product, not simply a viable one.
