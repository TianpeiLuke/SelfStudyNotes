## Invest

>[!question]
>_**What is the solution?** Why is it the right solution to address the customer need versus other alternatives?_

- This stage is in *Solution Space*.
- Similar to [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.3 Value Proposition]]
- We need to define value proposition
	- What are must-haves
	- What are performance benefits that our product need to address
	- What are delighters in our product
- Compare with competitors.
- This part discuss on how to compare with existing products based on how different customer needs are fulfilled
- This part also associate with common team collaboration, brainstorming etc.

### **What is the Invest stage?**

>[!quote]
>Now is your chance to *Think Big* and get creative! We’re inventing the future — it can be messy. How can you solve the customer problem or opportunity that you identified in the Define stage? How do you know if your idea is a ‘good’ one? Inventing and ideating is a lot more effective — and more fun — when it *involves others*. **Bring in team members** or anyone you think will *add to the process and think differently*. In the Invent stage, we think up big ideas and **prioritize** the best solutions to **fit the customer problem** or opportunity.

### **How do you take action in the Define stage?**

| **Recommended Actions**                                                                                                                                 | **Resources**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Resource Descriptions**                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

>[!info]
>A **How Might We** statement helps define the bigger-picture themes behind a customer problem or opportunity. **How Might We statements** help you get in the right mindset to Think Big and generate ideas to address the customer problem or opportunity.

		- **Remove the bad**: How can you minimize or separate a negative element of a situation? 
		- **Explore the opposite**: How can you flip a problem into an advantage?
