# Introduction

> [!info]
> **LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
> 
> - **Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
> - **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)
> [link](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction)

>[!important]
> This framework consists of several parts.
> 
> - **LangChain Libraries**: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents.
> - **[LangChain Templates](https://python.langchain.com/docs/templates)**: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks.
> - **[LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve)**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.
> - **[LangSmith](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langsmith)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.
