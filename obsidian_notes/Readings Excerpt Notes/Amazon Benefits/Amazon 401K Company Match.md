The Amazon 401(k) Plan is a valuable retirement savings tool that allows employees to save for their future while receiving company matching contributions. 
- For every **$1** an employee contributes, up to **4% of their eligible compensation**, Amazon contributes **50** cents, providing a match of up to **2%** of eligible pay. 
- 3-year vesting schedule (you need to stay 3 years to fully own company contributions)
- Employees can join immediately upon hire and contribute up to the IRS maximum allowable amounts ($23,500 in 2025 or $31,000 if age 50+ with the allowable $7,500 catch-up contribution).. If you do not actively enroll in the plan or opt out of participation, you will be automatically enrolled with a pre-tax contribution of 2% within around 90 days of hire. The plan offers tax advantages through pre-tax, Roth, and after-tax contribution options, as well as a range of investment choices to help employees meet their long-term savings goals. By participating in the 401(k), employees can take advantage of Amazon's matching funds to boost their retirement savings while reducing their current tax burden.

- Maximum company match varies based on salary
- **3-year vesting schedule** (you need to stay 3 years to fully own company contributions)

Meta:

- Matches 50% of employee contributions up to the IRS limit
- As of 2024, the IRS limit for employee contributions was $22,500 for those under 50
- Maximum company match: **$11,250 per year (50% of $22,500)**
- Immediate vesting (you own the company's contributions right away)

Google (Alphabet):

Apple

Quick Comparison:

- Most generous: Google, Meta, and Microsoft (tied) due to *highest potential match* and *immediate vesting*
- Middle tier: Apple (good match percentage but salary-based cap)
- More limited: Amazon (salary-based cap and 3-year vesting)

Key Observations:

1. Google, Meta, and Microsoft follow identical matching structures
2. Amazon has the most restrictive policy with both *lower match* and *delayed vesting*
3. Apple's 100% match rate is highest, but the 6% salary cap can limit total matching
