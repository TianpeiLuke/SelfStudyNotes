- Paid time off is a benefit provided to Amazon eligible employees for a bank of hours in which they can take sick, vacation, paid personal time, jury and witness duty, bereavement, and holiday. Refer to individual policies and any state or local requirements for further clarification.

### Reporting Time Off / Providing Notification

- In most situations, you must comply with the normal absence reporting (call-in) procedures. However, if you cannot report an absence as required by the applicable procedure due to a sick and safe time-related reason, you will be required to report your absence as soon as possible.   To ensure that we are able to staff appropriately to meet customer demand, we expect that you provide as much notice as possible if you will be away from work. You are required to provide one hour advance notice via [Amazon A to Z​](http://atoz.amazon.work/). If you are leaving work early one hour advance notice is required to your manager. The intent of the notification is to understand the time you plan to leave early, reason for departure and any open issues related to your process path or personal life that you feel your manager should be aware of. It also enables your manager to plan accordingly to support the team and operations. We understand that there are unforeseen events that may result in less than a one hour notification. For those last minute issues or emergencies, please work with your manager. Use the table below to understand the notification requirements for each time off option.

### Paid Personal Time

Regular Full Time (Class F), Reduced-Time (Class R), and Part-Time employees (Class H) who are scheduled to work 20 or more hours per week will be granted up to 10 hours of personal time in January or on their date of hire and are eligible to use their paid personal time once the accrual has been recorded. Regular full-time employees accrue 8 hours (1 day) per month for 4 months, and then 6 hours in the final month of paid personal time, up to a **maximum of 48 hours** (6 days) per calendar year. Regular reduced-time and part-time employees who are expected to work at least 20 hours per week accrue paid personal time, prorated, based on their scheduled work hours up to a prorated calendar year maximum.

Paid Time Off Paid personal time is accrued during normally scheduled workweeks, while on paid personal time and vacation, and during any leaves of absence. Paid personal time will not accrue during any unpaid portions of a leave of absence. Paid personal time hours are accrued at the end of each pay period in accordance with the accrual rate set out in the chart below, and not on a daily basis.

### Vacation Time Off

Amazon believes that employees should earn and take vacation on a regular basis for their personal well-being and continued high performance. All regular employees (except as indicated below) who are regularly expected to work 20 or more hours per week accrue paid vacation during each pay period. Vacation may be **accrued up to 160 hours**. 

Regular employees who are scheduled to work 20 or more hours per week accrue paid vacation beginning on the date of hire based on their length of service. Regular reduced-time and part-time employees (Class R and Class H) accrue pro-rated vacation based on their scheduled work hours. Temporary or Seasonal employees who are converted to regular employees will begin accruing vacation on the day they become a regular employee.  
  
Vacation is accrued during normally scheduled workweeks while on vacation and paid personal time, and during any paid leaves of absence. Vacation will not accrue during the unpaid portions of a leave of absence. Vacation hours are accrued at the end of each pay period in accordance with the accrual rate set out in the chart below and not on a daily basis, unless required by state or local laws or regulations.  
  
Employees who return to employment with Amazon within 6 months of their termination date will accrue vacation at the same rate as they accrued vacation when their employment terminated.  Employees who return to employment longer than 6 months from their termination date will accrue vacation at the normal rate for new employees in their first year of employment. ​

### Unpaid Time Off

Amazon provides all regular employees with Unpaid Time in the form of hours and may only be used in full hour increments. UPT is added on the first of each quarter up to a maximum amount corresponding to the employee status type (see chart below). We understand there are unforeseen events that may be beyond your control. UPT is intended for those last minute issues or emergencies; otherwise one hour notification is required. UPT is unpaid and tracked according to the number of hours used.

You are able to cover UPT with personal time. The expectation to cover UPT with personal time is by the end of your next scheduled shift or pay period, whichever is sooner.   If your personal time balance is equal to or greater than the negative UPT balance, personal time may be used to cover your negative UPT balance "with or without notice." If you use more UPT than you have in your balance (in other words, you overdraft from your UPT account), your UPT balance will go into the negative. If you have a personal time off balance, Amazon will automatically use personal time off to cover your negative UPT balance. If you see “US Unpaid Time Overdraft” on your pay period breakdown, this indicates that you have a negative UPT balance (i.e. your UPT has “overdrafted”). When your UPT balance is negative by any amount, and your absence cannot be covered by any other time off option, Amazon will review your employment for performance management, discipline, and potential termination of employment. You are responsible for monitoring your UPT balance on a regular basis. Be sure to talk with your manager or HR if you have any questions or concerns regarding your UPT balance. In the event your UPT balance becomes negative and your time missed is not covered by any other time off policy, your employment status will be reviewed for termination.

Full-time Associate will obtain 3 minutes of unpaid time off per hour worked. This would equal 120 minutes for 40 hours of work. 

Part-time Associate will obtain 5 minutes of unpaid time off per hour worked. This would equal 100 minutes for 20 hours of work.
