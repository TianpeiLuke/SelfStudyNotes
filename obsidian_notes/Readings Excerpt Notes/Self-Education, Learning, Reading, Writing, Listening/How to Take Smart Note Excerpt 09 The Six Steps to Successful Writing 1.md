## The Six Steps to Successful Writing

### 9 Separate and Interlocking Tasks
#### 9.1 Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention

>it is obvious that we are surrounded by more sources of distraction and less opportunities to train our attention spans.

#### 9.2 Multitasking is not a good idea

>If more than one thing tries to catch your attention, the temptation is great to look at more than one thing at the same time – to multitask. 

>what is most interesting about these studies is not the fact that the **productivity and the quality of the work decreases with multitasking**, but that it also impairs the ability to deal with more than one thing at a time!

>This result is surprising, because we usually expect to become better at something the more often we do it. But on a closer look, it makes sense. **Multitasking** is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on more than one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask, **what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things.** And **every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreases our ability to deal with more than one task.**

>The fact that people nevertheless believe that they can get better at it and increase their productivity can easily be explained by two factors. The first is the lack of a control group or an objective external measurement that would provide us with the feedback we need to learn. The second is what psychologists call **the mere-exposure effect**: **doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it** – completely independent of our actual performance (Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to **confuse familiarity with skill**.

>it does have practical consequences for the way we work if we think about what “writing” truly means: **many different tasks we might end up trying to do at the same time if we don’t separate them consciously and practically.**

>Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. **It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to *have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.***

>Usually, when we think about attention, we only think about **focused attention** – something that requires willpower to sustain. 

>When it comes to focused attention, we focus on one thing only, something we can sustain for only a few seconds. ... Focused attention is different from **“sustained attention,”** which we need to stay focused on one task for a longer period and is necessary to learn, understand or get something done. This is the kind of attention that is most certainly under threat from *an increase in distractions.* The average duration seems to have shrunken quite considerably over time – we practice much less focused attention than we used to (ibid).

>The good news is that we can train ourselves to stay focused on one thing for longer if we avoid multitasking, remove possible distractions and separate different kinds of tasks as much as possible so they will not interfere with each other. This too is not just a question of having the right mindset, but, equally important, of **how we organise our workflow.** A lack of structure makes it much more challenging to stay focused for extended periods of time. **The slip-box provides not only a clear structure to work in, but also forces us to shift our attention consciously as we can complete tasks in reasonable time before moving on to the next one.** Together with the fact that every task is accompanied by writing, which in itself requires undistracted attention, the slip-box can become a haven for our restless minds.


#### 9.3 Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention

>On closer look, it becomes obvious how different the tasks are that are usually summarised under “writing” and how different the kinds of attention are that they require.

>**Proofreading**, for example, is obviously part of the writing process, but requires a very different state of mind than the attempt to find the right words.

>While taking on the role of a **critic** is not the same as being an impartial reader, it is enough to spot most of what we missed before: the holes in the argument, the parts we did not explain as we did not need to explain them to ourselves.

>To be able to switch between the role of critic and the role of **writer** requires a clear separation between these two tasks, and that becomes easier with experience. If we proofread a manuscript and don’t manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text. 

>Letting the inner critic interfere with the author isn’t helpful, either. Here we have to focus our attention on our thoughts. 

>We need to get our thoughts on paper first and improve them there, where we can look at them. Especially complex ideas are difficult to turn into a linear text in the head alone. 

>If we try to please the critical reader instantly, our workflow would come to a standstill. ... Even though it sounds like praise for extreme professionalism, it is not: **A real professional would wait until it was time for proofreading, so he or she can focus on one thing at a time.** While proofreading requires more **focused attention**, finding the right words during writing requires much more **floating attention.**

>It is also easier to focus on finding the right words if we don’t have to think about the structure of the text at the same time, **which is why a printed outline of the manuscript should be always in front of our eyes.** We have to know what we don’t have to write about at the moment, because **we know that we will take care of that in another part of our text.**

>Outlining or changing the outline is also a very different task that requires a very different focus on something else: not on one thought, but on the whole argument. ..  **We need a structure all the time, but as we work our way bottom-up, it is bound to change often.** And whenever we need to update the structure, we need to **take a step back, look at the big picture and change it accordingly.**

>Working with the slip-box means **playing with ideas** and **looking out for interesting connections and comparisons.** It means **building clusters**, **combining them with other clusters** and **preparing the order of notes for a project.** Here, we need to puzzle with notes and find the best fit. It is much more associative, playful and creative than the other tasks and requires a very different kind of attention as well.

>**Reading in itself can require very different kinds of attention**, depending on the text. Some texts need to be read **slowly and carefully**, while others are only worth **skimming.** ... It is not a sign of professionalism to master one technique and stick to it no matter what, but to be **flexible** and adjust one’s reading to  whatever speed or approach a text requires.
>And the same is true for the work with the slip-box. To be able to focus on
the task at hand, we have to make sure other, unfinished tasks are not
lingering in our head and wasting precious mental resources.
>In short, academic writing requires the whole spectrum of attention. To master the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind of >attention and focus is needed.

>"Specifically, the problem solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands."

>What psychologists do not discuss, though, are **the external conditions** that allow us to be flexible in the first place. ... To be flexible, we need an equally **flexible work structure** that doesn’t break down every time we depart from a preconceived plan. 

#### 9.4 Become an Expert Instead of a Planner

>The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to **learn**. It is a matter of practice to become good at **generating insight** and write good texts by choosing and **moving flexibly between the most important and promising tasks,** judged by nothing else than the circumstances of the given situation.

>Similarly, no one would ever learn **the art of productive academic writing** just by following plans or linear, multistep prescripts – one would learn only to follow plans or prescripts. The widespread praise for planning rests on the misconception that a process like writing an academic text, which is **highly dependent on cognition and thinking**, can rely on **conscious decision-making alone.** But academic writing is an art, as well, which means it is something we can become better at with experience and deliberate practice.

>Experts rely on **embodied experience**, which enables them to reach the state of **virtuosity.**

>Each new project is different, and at each stage of the project, it might be best to read up on something, to review a passage, to discuss an idea or to change the outline of the manuscript. There is no universal rule that could tell one upfront at which stage it wouldn’t make sense to follow up on an idea, a possible contradiction or a footnote.

>To be able to become an expert, we need the **freedom to make our own decisions and all the necessary mistakes that help us learn.** ... But they are keeping you from learning the very thing academia and writing is all about: **gaining insight and making it public.**

>**gut feeling** is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience. It is the sedimentation of deeply learned practice through numerous feedback loops on success or failure.

>that success in academic writing depends to a great degree on **the organization of its practical side.** The workflow around the slip-box is not a prescription that tells you what to do at what stage of writing. On the contrary: It gives you **a structure of clearly separable tasks**, which can be completed within reasonable time and provides you with instant feedback through interconnected writing tasks. 


#### 9.5 Get Closure

>Attention is not our only limited resource. Our **short-term memory** is also limited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we can better delegate to an external system.

>Information cannot be saved in short-term memory like on a memory stick. Rather, it kind of floats around in our heads, seeks our attention and occupies valuable mental resources until it is either **forgotten**, **replaced by something more important (according to our brains)** or **moved into long-term memory.**

>This is why **it is so much easier to remember things we understand than things we don’t.** It is not that we have to choose to focus either on learning or understanding. **It is always about understanding** – and if it is only for the sake of learning. 

>Things we understand are **connected**, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. And **deliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the slip-box is all about.**

>Every step is accompanied by questions like: *How does this fact fit into my idea of …?* *How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory?* *Are these two ideas contradictory or do they complement each other?* *Isn’t this argument similar to that one? Haven’t I heard this before?* And above all: What does x mean for y? These questions not only increase our understanding, but facilitate learning as well. Once we make a meaningful connection to an idea or fact, it is difficult not to remember it when we think about what it is connected with.

>While we want to remember some things as long as possible, we don’t want to clog our brains with irrelevant information. And the way we organise everyday information makes a big difference not only for long-term memories, but short-term as well.

>**Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done.** That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. ... **All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of.** That’s right: **The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note.**

>By writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads. This is why David Allen’s **“Getting things done”** system works: The secret to have a “mind like water” is to **get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory.** And as we can’t take care of everything once and for all right now, the only way to do that is to have a reliable external system in place where we can keep all our nagging thoughts about the many things that need to be done and trust that they will not be lost.

>And the same is true for the work with the slip-box. To be able to focus on the task at hand, we have to make sure other, unfinished tasks are not lingering in our head and wasting precious mental resources.

>As the outcome of each task is written down and possible connections become visible, it is easy to pick up the work any time where we left it without having to keep it in mind all the time.

>Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind. ... Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way.


#### 9.6 Reduce the Number of Decisions

>the third **limited resource is motivation or willpower.** Here, too, the environmental design of our workflow makes all the difference. It shouldn’t come as a surprise anymore that a close cooperation with the slip-box turns out to be far superior to any sophisticated planning.

>**willpower is compared to muscles: a limited resource that depletes quickly and needs time to recover.** Improvement through training is possible to a certain degree, but takes time and effort. The phenomenon is usually discussed under the term **“ego depletion”**: “We use the term ego depletion to refer to a temporary reduction in the self’s capacity or willingness to engage in volitional action (including controlling the environment, controlling the self, making choices, and initiating action) caused by prior exercise of volition.” (Baumeister et al., 1998, 1253)

>The smartest way to deal with this kind of limitation is to cheat. Instead of forcing ourselves to do something we don’t feel like doing, we need to find a way to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along. Doing the work that need to be done without having to apply too much willpower requires a technique, a ruse.

>it is safe to argue that **a reliable and standardised working environment** is less taxing on our **attention, concentration and willpower**, or, if you like, **ego.** 

>In the way we organise our research and writing, we too can significantly reduce the amount of decisions we have to make. While content-related decisions have to be made (on what is more and what is less important in an article, on the connections between notes, the structure of a text, etc.), **most organisational decisions can be made up front, once and for all, by deciding *on one system.*** ... That leaves us with much more mental energy that we can direct towards more useful tasks, like trying to solve the problems in question.

>Being able to finish a task in a timely manner and to pick up the work exactly where we left it has another enjoyable advantage that helps to restore our attention: We can have breaks without fear of losing the thread.
