## The Four Underlying Principles

### 7 Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch

>The process of writing is vastly misunderstood. ... the rough order is always the same: **Make a decision on what to write about**, **plan your research**, **do your research**, **write**. Interestingly enough, these road maps usually come with the concession that this is only **an idealised plan and that in reality**, it rarely works like that. This is certainly true. **Writing can’t be that linear.**

>Every intellectual endeavour starts from an **already existing preconception**, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours.

>The seemingly pragmatic and down-to-earth- sounding advice – to decide what to write about before you start writing – is therefore either misleading or banal. It is banal if it means only that you should think before you put words on paper. It is misleading if it means that you could make a sound plan on what to write before you have immersed yourself in the topics at hand, which involves writing.

>We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by **our interest, curiosity and intuition**, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas – and is something that **continuously grows** and **reflects our knowledge and understanding *externally****.

>By focusing on what is **interesting** and **keeping written track of your own intellectual development**, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force.

>every question that emerges out of our slip-box will naturally and handily come with material to work with. If we look into our slip-box to see **where clusters have built up**, we not only see **possible topics**, but **topics we have already worked on** – even if we were not able to see it up front. The idea that nobody ever starts from scratch suddenly becomes very concrete. If we take it seriously and work accordingly, we literally never have to start from scratch again.

>As proper note-taking is rarely taught or discussed, it is no wonder that almost every guide on writing recommends to start with **brainstorming.** ... On its own, it is not such a great choice: it is **neither objective nor reliable** – two quite important aspects in academic or nonfiction writing. ... The things you are supposed to find in your head by brainstorming usually **don’t have their origins in there**. Rather, they **come from the outside**: through **reading**, having **discussions** and **listening** to others, through all the things that could have been accompanied and often even would have been improved by writing.

>The advice to think about what to write about before you write comes both **too early and too late**. Too late, as you already have **passed up the chance to build up written resources** when you face the white sheet of paper or the blank screen, but also too early, **if you try to postpone every serious content-related work until you have made a decision on the topic.**

>If something comes too early and too late at the same time, it is not possible to fix it by rearranging the order as the fictional linearity is the problem in itself. **Taking smart notes is the precondition to break with the linear order.** There is one reliable sign if you managed to **structure your workflow** according to the fact that **writing is not a linear process**, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about. ... If you on the other hand develop your **thinking in writing**, open questions will become clearly visible and give you an abundance of possible topics to elaborate further in writing.

>But those who have already developed their thinking through writing can keep the **focus on what is interesting** for them at the moment and **accumulate substantial material just by doing what they most feel like doing.** The material will **cluster around the questions** they returned to most often, so they don’t risk too far of a departure from their interest.

>Instead of spending your time worrying about finding the right topic, you will spend your time actually working on **your already existing interests** and **doing what is necessary to make informed decisions** – **reading, thinking and writing.** By doing the work, you can trust that interesting questions will emerge. You might not know where you will end up (and you don’t need to), but you can’t force insight into a preconceived direction anyway.

>Even though academic writing is not a linear process, that does not mean you should follow an anything-goes approach. On the contrary, **a clear, reliable structure is paramount.**
