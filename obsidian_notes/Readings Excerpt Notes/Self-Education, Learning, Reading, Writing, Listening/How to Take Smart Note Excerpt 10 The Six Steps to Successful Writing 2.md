## The Six Steps to Successful Writing

### 10 Read for Understanding

#### 10.1 Read With a Pen in Hand

>To get a good paper written, you only have to **rewrite a good draft**; to get a good draft written, you only have to **turn a series of notes into a continuous text.** And as a series of notes is just **the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box,** all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read.

>If you understand what you read and translate it into the different context of your own thinking, materialised in the slip-box, you cannot help but transform the findings and thoughts of others into something that is new and your own.

>It works both ways: The series of notes in the slip-box develops into arguments, which are shaped by the theories, ideas and mental models you have in your head. And the theories, ideas and mental models in your head are also shaped by the things you read. They are constantly changing and challenged by the surprising connections with which the slip-box confronts you. The richer the slip-box becomes, the richer your own thinking becomes. **The slip-box is an idea generator that develops in lockstep with your own intellectual development.** Together, you can turn previously separated or even isolated facts into a critical mass of interconnected ideas.

>The step from the slip-box to the final text is pretty **straightforward**. The content is already meaningful, thought through and in many parts already put into well-connected sequences. The notes only need to be **put into a linear order.** While the notes themselves are formulated so that they can be understood on their own, they are at the same time embedded in one or more contexts that enrich their meaning. 

>Therefore, the outcome is **never a copy of previous work,** but always comes with surprises. There will always be something you couldn’t have anticipated. Obviously, the same applies to every single step before. The outcome of reading with a pen in the hand is not possible to anticipate either, and here, too, **the idea is not to copy, but to have a meaningful dialogue with the texts we read.**

>When we extract ideas from the specific context of a text, we deal with ideas that serve a specific purpose in a particular context, support a specific argument, are part of a theory that **isn’t ours or written in a language we wouldn’t use.** This is why **we have to translate them into our own language to prepare them to be embedded into new contexts of our own thinking, the different context(s) within the slip-box.** Translating means to give the truest possible account of the original work, using different words – it does not mean the freedom to make something fit. As well, **the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren’t changed.** This is a common beginner mistake, which **can only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought.**

>While **the literature notes** will be stored within the reference system together with the bibliographic details, separate from the slip-box, but still close to the context of the original text, they are already **written with an eye towards the lines of thoughts within the slip-box.** 

>How extensive the **literature notes** should be really depends on the text and what we need it for. It also depends on our ability to be concise, the complexity of the text and how difficult it is to understand. As literature notes are also a tool for understanding and grasping the text, **more elaborate notes make sense in more challenging cases**, while in easier cases it might be **sufficient to just jot down some keywords.** 

>Whenever we explore a **new, unfamiliar subject**, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we **shouldn’t get nervous about it**, as this is the **deliberate practice of understanding we cannot skip.** Sometimes it is necessary to slowly work our way through a difficult text and sometimes it is enough to reduce a whole book to a single sentence. The only thing that matters is that these notes provide the best possible support for the next step, **the writing of the actual slip-box notes.**

>And what is most helpful is to reflect on the frame, the theoretical background, methodological approach or **perspective** of the text we read. That often means to reflect as much on what is not mentioned as what is mentioned

>Taking literature notes this way is very different from the way literature notes are taken by most students, which is either not systematic enough or overly systematic.... They do not clearly decide on the format and the organisation of their notes and do not have a plan for what to do with them afterwards. **Without a clear purpose for the notes, taking them will feel more like a chore than an important step within a bigger project.** 

>Sometimes, long excerpts are written with good intentions, but that is not sustainable. Sometimes the only thing that is done is underlining sentences and making some comments in the margins of a book, which is almost like taking no notes at all. And more often than not, reading is not accompanied by taking notes, which is, in terms of writing, almost as valuable as not having read at all. 

>Here, **everything is about building up a critical mass of useful notes in the slip-box**, which gives us a **clear idea** of **how to read and how to take literature notes.**

>all of this would be just an extra step before you do the only step that really counts, which is to take the permanent note that will add value to the actual slip-box. You need to take some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box note. But don’t turn it into a project in itself. **Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes.** **Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction.**


#### 10.2 Keep an Open Mind

>While selectivity is the key to smart note-taking, it is equally important to be selective in a smart way. Unfortunately, our brains are not very smart in selecting information by default. While we should seek out dis-confirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking, we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything that confirms what we already believe we know

>The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically go into search mode, scanning our surroundings for supporting data, which is neither a good way to learn nor research. Worse, we are usually not even aware of this **confirmation bias** (or myside bias[28]) that surreptitiously meddles with our life. 

>Even the best scientists and thinkers are not free from it. What sets them apart is the mere fact that they are aware of the problem and do something about it. The classic role model would be Charles Darwin. He **forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories.** "... whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which **was opposed to my general results**, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; ..."

>With a good system, the mere necessities of the workflow will force us to act more virtuously without actually having to become more virtuous. Confirmation bias is tackled here in two steps: First, by turning the whole writing process on its head, and secondly, by changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to **an indiscriminate gathering of any relevant information regardless of what argument it will support.**

>Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight. ... We **postpone the decision on what to write about specifically** and focus on **building a critical mass within the slip-box**.

>Instead of having the hypothesis in mind all the time, we want to:
>- Confirm that we have **separated tasks** and **focus on understanding the text we read**,
>- Make sure we have given a true **account of its content**.
>- Find the **relevance** of it and make connections.
>  
>Only then do we take a step back to look at what developed, then make a decision on what conclusions are to be drawn from that.

>The slip-box forces us to **be selective in reading and note-taking**, but the only criterion is the question of **whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box.** The only thing that matters is that **it connects or is open to connections.** Everything can contribute to **the development of thoughts** within the slip-box: an addition as well as a contradiction, the questioning of a seemingly obvious idea as well as the differentiation of an argument. What we are looking for are facts and information that **can add something and therefore enrich the slip-box**. One of the most important **habitual changes** when starting to work with the slip-box is moving the attention from the individual project with our preconceived ideas towards the open connections within the slip-box.

>After aligning our interests, we can go a step further and prime ourselves for seeking out **dis-confirming facts.** ... we have to be selective...  in terms of relevant or irrelevant. ... And the more diverse the content of the slip-box is, the further it can bring our thinking forward – provided we haven’t decided on the direction upfront. **Contradictions within the slip-box** can be discussed on follow-up notes or even in the final paper. It is so much easier to develop an interesting text from a lively discussion with a lot of pros and cons than from a collection of one-sided notes and seemingly fitting quotes.

>The slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers **relevant notes**. It is **after** reading and collecting relevant data, connecting thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument.

#### 10.3 Get the Gist

>The ability to distinguish relevant from less relevant information is another skill that can only be learned by doing. It is the practice of **looking for the gist** and **distinguishing it from mere supporting details.** 

>Extracting the gist of a text or an idea and giving an account in writing is for academics what daily practice on the piano is for pianists: The more often we do it and the more focused we are, the more virtuous we become

>**Patterns** that help us navigate texts and discourses are not only theories, concepts or the respective terminology, but also typical mistakes we automatically scan an argument for, general categories we apply, writing styles that indicate a certain school of thought or mental models we learn or develop from different insights and can collect like a great and ever-increasing set of thinking tools. 

>with the learned ability of spotting patterns, we can enter **the circle of virtuosity**: Reading becomes easier, we **grasp the gist** quicker, can read more in less time, and can more easily **spot patterns** and **improve our understanding of them**. And along the way, we increase our set of thinking tools, which will not only help with academic work, but with thinking and understanding in general.

>The better you become in doing this, the quicker you can jot down notes, which are still helpful. ... With practice comes the ability to **find the right words to express something in the best possible way**, which means in a simple, but not simplified way. ... It spills over into speaking and thinking. It is proven that readers regard an author and an audience a speaker as **more intelligent the more clear and to the point their expressions are (Oppenheimer 2006).**

>The ability to spot patterns, to question the frames used and detect the distinctions made by others, is **the precondition to thinking critically** and looking behind the assertions of a text or a talk. Being able to re-frame questions, assertions and information is even more important than having an extensive knowledge, because without this ability, we wouldn’t be able to put  our knowledge to use. 

#### 10.4 Learn to Read

>**Permanent notes**, too, are directed towards an audience **ignorant of the thoughts behind the text** and **unaware of the original context**, only equipped with a general knowledge of the field. 

>“The principle is that you must not **fool yourself**, and you are the easiest person to fool,” Feynman stressed in a speech to young scientists (Feynman 1985, 342). **Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text.** Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. On top of that, we also tend to like it more (Bornstein 1989).

>While it is obvious that **familiarity is not understanding**, we have no chance of knowing whether we understand something or just believe we understand something until we **test ourselves in some form**. If we don’t try to verify our understanding during our studies, we will happily enjoy the feeling of getting smarter and more knowledgeable while in reality staying as dumb as we were.

>The attempt to **rephrase an argument** in our own words **confronts us without mercy with all the gaps in our understanding.** It certainly feels less good, but this struggle is the only chance we have to improve our understanding, to learn and move forward (cf. below).

>To certain degree, **learning is understanding**. And the mechanisms are not so different, either: We can only improve our learning if we **test ourselves on our progress.** Only **the actual attempt to retrieve information** will clearly show us if we have learned something or not. The mere-exposure effect would fool us here, too: **Seeing something we have seen before** causes the same emotional reaction as if we had been able to **retrieve the information from our memory.** Rereading, therefore, makes us feel we have learned what we read.

>This is why choosing an external system that forces us to deliberate practice and confronts us as much as possible with our lack of understanding or not-yet-learned information is such a smart move. We only have to make the conscious choice once.

#### 10.5 Learn by Reading

>Learning itself requires **deliberate practice**... And deliberate practice is demanding; it requires effort. Trying to skip this step would be like going to the gym and trying to work out with the least effort possible.

>When we try to answer a question before we know how to, we will later remember the answer better, even if our attempt failed (Arnold and McDermott 2013). 

>If we put effort into **the attempt of retrieving information,** we are much more likely to remember it in the long run, even if we fail to retrieve it without help in the end (Roediger and Karpicke 2006).

>In short: **Pure re-viewing just doesn’t make any sense, neither for understanding nor for learning.** It is debatable if we even can call it learning.

>It is not surprising, therefore, that the best-researched and most successful learning method is **elaboration.** It is very similar to what we do when we take smart notes and combine them with others, which is the opposite of mere reviewing (Stein et al. 1984) Elaboration means nothing other than really thinking about **the meaning of what we read,** **how it could inform different questions and topics** and **how it could be combined with other knowledge.** In fact, “**Writing for Learning**” is the name of an “**elaboration method**” (Gunel, Hand, and Prain 2007). 

>The slip-box takes care of **storing facts and information**. **Thinking and understanding is what it can’t take off your shoulders**, which is why it makes sense to focus on this part of the work. That it facilitates learning as well is a nice side effect.

>Working with the slip-box, therefore, doesn’t mean storing information in there instead of in your head, i.e. not learning. On the contrary, it **facilitates real, long-term learning.** It just means not cramming isolated facts into your brain – something you probably wouldn’t want to do anyway.

>The objection that it takes too much time to take notes and sort them into the slip-box is therefore short-sighted. Writing, taking notes and thinking about how ideas connect is exactly the kind of elaboration that is needed to learn. Not learning from what we read because we don’t take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of time.

>There is a clear division of labour between the brain and the slip-box: The slip-box takes care of **details and references** and is **a long-term memory resource** that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows t**he brain to focus on the gist**, the **deeper understanding** and the **bigger picture**, and frees it up to be **creative**. Both the brain and the slip-box can focus on what they are best at.
