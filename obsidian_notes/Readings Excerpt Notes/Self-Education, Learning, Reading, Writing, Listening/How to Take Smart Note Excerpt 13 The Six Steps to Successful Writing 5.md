## The Six Steps to Successful Writing

### 13 Share Your Insight

>Since writing is nothing more than the revision of a rough draft, which is nothing more than turning a series of notes into a continuous text, which are written on a day-to-day basis, connected and indexed in the **slip-box**, there is no need to worry about finding a topic to write about. Just look into your slip- box and see where **clusters** have been built up. These clusters are what caught your interest again and again, so you already know that you have found material to work with.

>Now you can spread out these notes on your desktop or use the outliner of the Zettelkasten, **outline your argument and construct a preliminary order of sections**, chapters or paragraphs. This will **make questions**, which are not answered, obvious, and it will show the **gaps in the argument** that need to be filled and make visible which parts still need some work.

>Now, it is not about understanding something in the context of **another** author’s argument, and it is also not about **looking for multiple connections in the slip-box**, but about **developing one argument and bringing it into the linearity of a manuscript**.

#### 13.1 From Brainstorming to Slip-box-Storming


>Instead of **widening the perspective** to find as many possible lines of thought to which an idea might contribute, it is now about **narrowing the perspective**, making a decision on one topic only and cutting out everything that does not directly contribute to the development of the text and support the main argument.

>While we want to find topics that are important, interesting and can be dealt with using the material we have available, the *brain **prioritises ideas that are easily available in the moment.***

>The brain more easily remembers information that it **encountered recently**, which has emotions attached to it and is lively, concrete or specific. Ideally, it rhymes as well (cf. Schacter, 2001; Schacter, Chiao and Mitchell, 2003). Everything that is rather abstract, vague, emotionally neutral or does not even sound good is far down on its list of priorities – not exactly the best criteria for an intellectual endeavour.

>Those who rely on their brains will first ask themselves, then their supervisor... On the other hand, we who have already accompanied our studies by writing and collecting notes in a smart way simply don’t have the need for brainstorming anymore.

>Every time we make a permanent note, we also made a decision about the aspects of a text we regarded as **relevant** for our longer- term thinking and relevant for the development of our ideas. We constantly make explicit how ideas and information **connect** with each other and turn them into literal connections between our notes. By doing this, we develop visible clusters of ideas that are now ready to be turned into manuscripts.

>The process is **self-reinforcing**. A visibly developed cluster attracts more ideas and provides more possible connections, which in return influence our choices on what to read and think further.

>It is the one decision in the beginning, to make writing the mean and the end of the whole intellectual endeavour, that changed the role of topic-finding completely. 

>By generating questions in the course of our everyday work, we bring the law of large numbers on our side. The truth is that few questions are suitable to be answered within an article, a thesis or a book. Some are too broad, some are too narrow, some are impossible to answer with knowledge we can reasonably acquire, but **for most, we just don’t have the material to work with.** Those who start with a plan and an idea about what to write will probably encounter that truth somewhere along the way. They then might be able to correct an unfortunate choice once or twice, but will have to stick with what they have chosen at one point, otherwise they will never finish their project.

>let questions arise from the slip-box

>**Good questions** are in the sweet spot of being **relevant and interesting**, **not too easy to answer** but **possible to tackle** with material that is available or at least within our reach. When it comes to finding good questions, it is therefore **not enough to think about it**. We have to do something with an idea before we know enough about it to make a good judgement. We have to work, write, connect, differentiate, complement and elaborate on questions – but this is what we do when we take smart notes.

#### 13.2 From Top Down to Bottom Up

>The ideas we decide on are **not taken out of thin air**, but are **already embedded** in a content-rich context and come with material that we can use. Starting with what we have also comes with another, unexpected advantage: We become more open to new ideas.

>It makes sense when you think about it: without **intense elaboration** on what we already know, we would have trouble seeing its **limitations**, what is missing or possibly wrong. Being intimately familiar with something enables us to *be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas* without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new.

>This is why it feels in the beginning that **familiarity makes it harder to come up with new ideas.** We just didn’t know that most of the ideas we had are actually not that innovative.

#### 13.3 Getting Things Done by Following Your Interests

>It is not surprising that **motivation** is shown to be one of the most important indicators for successful students – next to the feeling of being in control of one’s own learning course.

>These findings are an important argument for academic freedom. Nothing motivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with moving forward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a project that doesn’t seem to be worth doing.

>**The risk of losing interest** in what we do is **high** when we decide **upfront** on a **long-term project without much clue about what to expect**. We can mitigate this risk considerably by applying a flexible organisation scheme that allows us to change course whenever necessary.

>The ability to **change the direction** of our work **opportunistically** is a form of control that is completely different from the attempt to **control the circumstances** by **clinging to a plan**.

>The ability to keep control over our work and change course if necessary is made possible by the fact that **the big task of “writing a text” is broken down into small, concrete tasks**, which allows us practically to do exactly what is needed at a certain time and take the next step from there.

>And the more control we have to steer our work towards what we consider interesting and relevant, the less willpower we have to put into getting things done.


#### 13.4 Finishing and Review

>There is not much left to say about the last two steps because the main work is already done.

>**A key point: Structure the text and keep it flexible.** While the slip-box was very much about experimenting with and generating new ideas, we now need to bring our thoughts into a linear order.**The key is to structure the draft visibly.** It is not so much about deciding once and for all what to write in which chapter or paragraph, but what does not need to be written in a particular part of the manuscript. By looking at the (always preliminary) structure, you can see if information will be mentioned in another part.

>Another key point: **Try working on different manuscripts at the same time.** While the slip-box is already helpful to get one project done, its real strength comes into play when we start working on multiple projects at the same time.

>The process of reading and writing inevitably produces a lot of **unintended by-products.** **Not all ideas can fit into the same article**, and only a fraction of the information we encounter is useful for one particular project.

>If we read something that is interesting, but **not directly relevant** to our current project, we can **still use it for another project** we are working on or might work on. ... By taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place. The projects we work on can be in completely different stages of completion. ... This is advantageous not only because we make progress on the next papers or books while we are still working on the current one, but also because it allows us to switch to other projects whenever we get stuck or bored.



#### 13.5 Becoming an Expert by Giving up Planning

>Interestingly, the majority of the student’s “realistic” estimates were not so different from their **estimates for writing under perfect conditions**.

>Even the people who study this phenomenon, which is called **the overconfidence bias**, admit that they too fall for it (Kahneman 2013, 245ff).

>The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal.

>Having a more realistic idea in mind not only helps them to perform better, it also boosts their motivation (Singer et al. 2001).

>The other lesson is not that we can’t learn from our experiences, but that we can only learn from our experiences if **feedback follows shortly afterwards** – and maybe more than once in a while. **Disassembling the big challenge** of “writing a paper” **into small, manageable tasks** helps to set realistic goals that can be checked on a regular basis.

>Once we do some research, we may discover that our initial idea was not as good as we thought; once we read something, it is likely that we will discover something else to read, because that is how we discover literature; once we start writing down our arguments, it is likely that we will realise that we need to take something else into account, change our initial ideas or go back to an article we might not have understood well enough. None of this is unusual, but all of this will **mess up any grand plans**.

>The problem with the linear model is not just that one phase might need longer than planned, but that it is highly **unlikely** that we will **finish a phase sooner than planned**.

>If we have the finish line in sight, we tend to speed up, as everyone knows who has ever run a marathon. **That means that the most important step is to get started.**

#### 13.6 The Actual Writing

>If there is one piece of advice that is worth giving, it is to keep in mind that **the first draft is only the first draft.**

>One of the most difficult tasks is to **rigorously delete** what **has no function within an argument** – “kill your darlings.” This becomes much easier when you move the questionable passages into another document and tell yourself you might use them later.
