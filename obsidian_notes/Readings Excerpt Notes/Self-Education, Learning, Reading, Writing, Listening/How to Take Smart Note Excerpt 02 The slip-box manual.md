## Book Excerpt

##### 1.3 The slip-box manual

> How does the slip-box, the heart of this system, work?
> 
> Strictly speaking, Luhmann had two slip-boxes: **a bibliographical one**, which contained the *references and brief notes on the content of the literature*, and **the main one** in which he *collected and generated his ideas*, mainly in response to what he read. The notes were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes.
> 
> Whenever he read something, he would write *the bibliographic information on one side of a card* and *make brief notes about the content on the other side* (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box. 
> 
> In a second step, shortly after, he would look at *his brief notes* and **think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing**. He then would turn to *the main slip-box and write his ideas*, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using *only one for each idea* and *restricting himself to one side of the paper*, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box. He **kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet**, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought.

>He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but *made a transition from one context to another*. It was very much like a translation where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the original meaning as truthfully as possible.

>The **trick** is that *he did **not** organise his notes **by topic**, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers.* The numbers bore no meaning and were only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note.

>Whenever he added a note, he **checked his slip-box** for other relevant notes to **make possible connections** between them. Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system. 

>By adding these **links between notes**, Luhmann was able to add the same note to different contexts. While other systems start with *a preconceived order of topics*, Luhmann **developed topics bottom up**, then added another note to his slip-box, on which he would *sort a topic by sorting the links of the relevant other notes*.

>The last element in his file system was an **index**, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with **a sorted collection of links** are, of course, **good entry points**.
