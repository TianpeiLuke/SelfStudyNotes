## Book Excerpt

##### 2 Everything You Need to Do

>Writing these notes is also not the main work. **Thinking is**. **Reading is**. **Understanding and coming up with ideas is**. And this is how it is supposed to be. **The notes are just the tangible outcome of it.** All you have to do is to have a pen in your hand while you are doing what you are doing anyway (or a keyboard under your fingers). Writing notes accompanies the main work and, done right, it helps with it. 

>Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway. If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. 

>If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: **You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write**. Richard Feynman stresses it as much as Benjamin Franklin. If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to **build up the resources for our future publications?**
