## The Six Steps to Successful Writing

### 11 Take Smart Notes

>Experienced academic readers usually **read a text with questions in mind** and try to **relate it to other possible approaches**, while inexperienced readers tend to adopt the question of a text and the frames of the argument and take it as a given. What good readers can do is **spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.**

>Even more problematic than staying within the given frame of a text or an argument is *the inability to interpret particular information in the text **within the bigger frame or argument of the text.*** Even doctoral students sometimes just ***collect de-contextualised quotes from a text*** – probably the worst possible approach to research imaginable. This makes it almost impossible to understand the actual meaning of information. Without understanding information within its context, it is also impossible to go beyond it, to **reframe** it and to **think about what it could mean for another question.**

>scientific thinking is plainly impossible if we can’t manage to think beyond a given context and we only focus on the information as it is given to us (Bruner, 1973, quoted after ibid.) It is not surprising, therefore, that Lonka recommends what Luhmann recommends: **Writing brief accounts on the main ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes.** And she also stresses that it is no less important to do something with these ideas – to think hard about how they connect with other ideas from different contexts and could inform questions that are not already the questions of the author of the respective text

>This is exactly what we do when we take the next step, in which we write and add permanent notes to the slip-box. ... We **think about what they mean for other lines of thoughts**, then we **write this explicitly on paper and connect them literally with the other notes.**

#### 11.1 Make a Career One Note at a Time

>Academic or nonfiction texts are not written like this **because in addition to the writing, there is the reading, the research, the thinking and the tinkering with ideas.** And they almost always take significantly more time than expected: If you ask academic or nonfiction writers, students or professors how much time they expect it would take them to finish a text, they systematically underestimate the time they need – even when they are asked to estimate the time under the worst-case scenario and if the real conditions turned out to be quite favourable (Kahneman 2013, 245ff). 

>It does make sense to break down the work into **manageable and  measurable steps,** but pages per day don’t work that well as a unit when you also have to read, do research and think. 

>Putting notes into the slip-box, however, is like investing and reaping the rewards of **compounded interest** (which would in this example almost pay for the whole flat).

>And likewise, the sum of the slip-box content is worth much more than the sum of the notes. More notes mean more possible connections, more ideas, **more synergy between different projects and therefore a much higher degree of productivity.**

>you could settle for **three notes a day** and still build up a significant critical mass of ideas in a very reasonable time. ... In contrast to manuscript pages per day, a certain number of notes a day is a reasonable goal for academic writing. And that is because taking a note and sorting it into the slip-box can be done in one go, while writing a manuscript page could involve weeks and months of preparation involving other tasks as well.  You could therefore **measure your daily productivity by the number of notes written.**

#### 11.2 Think Outside the Brain

>Taking literature notes is **a form of deliberate practice as it gives us feedback on our understanding or lack of it**, while the effort to put into our own words the gist of something is at the same time the best approach to understanding what we read.

>Taking permanent notes of our own thoughts is a form of self-testing as well

>When we take permanent notes, it is much more **a form of thinking within the medium of writing** and **in dialogue with the already existing notes within the slip-box than a protocol of preconceived ideas.** Any thought of a certain complexity requires writing. Coherent arguments require the language to be fixed, and only if something is written down is it fixed enough to be  discussed independently from the author. 

>Only in the written form can an argument be **looked at with a certain distance** – literally. **We need this distance to think about an argument – otherwise the argument itself would occupy the very mental resources we need for scrutinizing it.**

>As we write notes with an eye towards existing notes, we take more into account than the information that is already available in our internal memory. That is extremely important, because the internal memory retrieves information not in a rational or logical way, but according to psycho-logical rules. 

>The brain also doesn’t store information neurally and objectively. We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information. The brain works with rules of thumb and makes things look as if they fit, even if they don’t. **It remembers events that never happened, connects unrelated episodes to convincing narratives and completes incomplete images.** It cannot help but see patterns and meaning everywhere, even in the most random things (cf. Byrne, 2008). The brain, as Kahneman writes, is “**a machine for jumping to conclusions**” (Kahneman, 2013, 79). 

>Luhmann states as clearly as possible: **it is not possible to think systematically without writing** (Luhmann 1992, 53). 

> Philosophers, neuroscientists, educators and psychologists like to disagree in many different aspects on how the brain works. But they no longer disagree when it comes to the need for **external scaffolding.** Almost all agree nowadays that real thinking requires some kind of **externalization**, especially in the form of writing. 

>In our system, the scaffolding is done explicitly by connecting the thoughts within the external memory of the slip-box. Luhmann writes: “Somehow one has to **mark differences, keep track of distinctions, either explicitly or implicitly in concepts**,” because only if the connections are somehow fixed externally can they function as models or theories to give meaning and continuity for further thinking (Luhmann, 1992, 53).

>A common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is by **writing out the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought.** 

>I **took some literature notes**...This was step one, done with an eye towards the argument of the book. I **had questions in mind** like: Is this convincing? What methods do they use? Which of the references are familiar?
>
>But the first question I asked myself when it came to **writing the first permanent note for the slip-box** was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?
>
>...This immediately triggers **further questions**, which I can discuss on following notes, **starting with: “Why?”**
>
>Now, I already have **two notes in my slip-box**, based on the **literature notes** I took while reading the book, but written along the lines of my own thinking. One note states **the relevance of the book for my own thinking** and one **explains my idea in more detail.** 
>
>.While I am writing these notes, it becomes obvious that the answer to the question “why” has already **triggered more follow-up questions** 
>
>By **skimming through the slip-box**, I might discover that these ideas could also be **helpful for another topic I haven’t thought about.**... None of it needs to be discussed right away, especially as most of these ideas would require more research and reading. But there is also no reason not to write down these possible connections and come back to them later, if my research points me back to them. The more notes the slip-box contains, the more interesting and prolific this step will become and the more research questions will be triggered.

#### 11.3 Learn by not Trying

>We have seen in the **first step** that **elaboration through taking smart literature notes increases the likelihood that we will remember what we read in the long term.** But this was only the first step. **Transferring these ideas into the network of our own thoughts**, our latticework of theories, concepts and mental models **in the slip-box** brings our thinking to the **next level.**

>The literature notes are going to be archived, which means the ideas would be lost in the reference system if we didn’t do something with them. That is why we transfer them into our external memory, the slip-box, with which we have an ongoing dialogue and where they can become part of our active set of ideas.

>**Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them.** And even though it sounds paradoxical, forgetting actually facilitates long-term learning. 

>Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a  mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism **active inhibition** (cf. MacLeod, 2007). It is easy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to **focus** on anything in our surroundings.

>It is difficult, if not impossible, to verify this claim, but *it does make sense to shift the attention from **storage strength** to **retrieval strength.*** Learning would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about **building connections and bridges between pieces of information to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment.** It is about making sure that the right “**cues**” trigger the right memory, about how we can think strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it.

>What does help for true, useful learning is to *connect a piece of information to as **many meaningful contexts** as possible*, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes. Making these connections *deliberately* means building up a **self-supporting network of interconnected ideas and facts that work reciprocally as cues for each other.**

>Memory artists instead attach meaning to information and connect it to already known networks of connections in a meaningful way. One piece of information can become the cue for another and strings or networks of cues can be built. 

>Memory techniques are the fix for a rather artificial situation. When it comes to academic writing, we don't have the need for this trick, as we can choose to build and think exclusively within meaningful contexts. 

>**The challenge of writing as well as learning** is therefore not so much to learn, but to **understand**, as we will already have learned what we understand. The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious and needs to be explored. That is why we need to **elaborate** on it. But elaboration is nothing more than **connecting information to other information in a meaningful way.** The first step of elaboration is to **think enough** about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means **for other contexts** as well.

>**Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to understand the wider meaning of something.** The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to … ? What is the difference between … ? What is it similar to? That the slip-box is **not sorted by topics** is the precondition for actively building connections between notes. ... The slip-box is forcing us to do the exact opposite: **To elaborate, to understand, to connect and therefore to learn seriously.**

>**elaborating on the differences and similarities of notes** instead of sorting them by topic not only facilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to categorise and create sensible classifications!

#### 11.4 Adding Permanent Notes to the Slip-Box

>The next step after writing the permanent notes is to add them to the slip-box.
>1. Add a note to the slip-box either behind the note you directly refer to or, if you do not follow up on a specific note, just behind the last note in the slip-box. **Number it consecutively**. The Zettelkasten numbers the notes automatically. “New note” will just add a note with a new number. If you click “New note sequence,” the new note will be registered at the same time as the note that follows the note currently active on the screen. But you can always add notes “behind” other notes anytime later. Each note can follow multiple other notes and therefore be part of different note sequences.
>2. Add links to other notes or links on other notes to your new note.
>3. Make sure it can be found **from the index**; **add an entry in the index** if necessary or refer to it from a note that is connected to the index.
>4. Build a Latticework of Mental Models
