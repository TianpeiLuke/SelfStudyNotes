## The Four Underlying Principles

### 6 Simplicity Is Paramount

>We tend to think that big transformations have to start with an equally big idea. But more often than not, it is the simplicity of an idea that makes it so powerful (and often overlooked in the beginning).

>In hindsight, we know why they failed: The ship owners tried to integrate the container into their usual way of working without changing the infrastructure and their routines. ... In the beginning, the perception was very much shaped by what worked before, and only the most immediate effects were visible. ... Only after aligning every single part of the delivery chain, from packaging to delivery, from the design of the ships to the design of the harbours, was the full potential of the container unleashed.
>
>When the advantages became obvious, second-order effects came into play and went into a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. ... It wasn’t just another way of shipping goods. It was a whole new way of doing business.

>Many students and academic writers think like the early ship owners when it comes to **note-taking**. They handle their ideas and findings in the way it makes **immediate sense**: If they read an interesting sentence, they **underline** it. If they have a comment to make, they write it into the **margins**. If they have an idea, they write it into their **notebook**, and if an article seems important enough, they make the effort and write an **excerpt**. Working like this will leave you with **a lot of different notes in many different places.** Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to **remember where and when these notes were written down.** A text must then be conceptualised independently from these notes, which explains why so many resort to ***brainstorming*** to arrange the resources afterwards according to this preconceived idea. ... it indeed does not make much sense to **rewrite these notes and put them into a box**, only to **take them out again later** when a certain quote or reference is needed during writing and thinking.

>Most students sort their material by topic or even by seminars and semester.

>**The slip-box** is the shipping container of the academic world. Instead of having different storage for different ideas, **everything goes into the same slip-box and is standardised into the same format.** ... everything is streamlined towards one thing only: **insight that can be published.**

>The **biggest advantage** compared to a ***top-down storage system organised by topics*** is that the slip-box becomes more and more **valuable** the more it **grows**, instead of getting *messy and confusing.*

>If you sort by topic, you are faced with the dilemma of either adding more and more notes to one topic, which makes them increasingly hard to find, or adding more and more topics and subtopics to it, which only shifts the mess to another level. 

>The slip-box is designed to **present you with ideas you have already forgotten**, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.

>Even though the slip-box, **being organised bottom-up**, does not face the trade-off problem between too many or too few topics, it too can **lose its value *when notes are added to it indiscriminately.***

>It can only play out its strengths when we aim for ***a critical mass***, which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled.

>To achieve a critical mass, it is crucial to distinguish clearly between three types of notes:
  1. **Fleeting notes**, which are **only reminders of information**, can be written in any kind of way and will ***end up in the trash within a day or two.***
 > 2. **Permanent notes**, which will ***never be thrown away*** and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box.
 > 3. **Project notes**, which are ***only relevant to one particular project.*** They are kept within a **project-specific folder** and can be ***discarded or archived*** after the project is finished.
 >    
> Only if the notes of these three categories are kept **separated** it will be possible to build *a critical mass of ideas within the slip-box.* One of the major reasons for not getting much writing or publishing done lies in the **confusion of these categories.**

>A typical mistake ... As he treats *every note as if it belongs to the “permanent” category*, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight.

>The second typical mistake is to collect notes ***only related to specific projects.*** ... The disadvantage is that you have to *start all over* after each project and cut off all other promising lines of thought. That means that everything you found, thought or encountered during the time of a project will be lost. ... without a **permanent reservoir of ideas**, you will not be able to develop any major ideas over a longer period of time because you are restricting yourself either to **the length of a single project** or **the capacity of your memory.** Exceptional ideas need much more than that.

>The third typical mistake is, of course, to treat all notes as fleeting ones. ... **Just collecting unprocessed fleeting notes inevitably leads to chaos.** Even small amounts of unclear and unrelated notes lingering around your desk will soon induce the wish of starting from scratch.

>What all these **category-confusing** approaches have in common is that **the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep.**

>It is important to reflect on the **purpose** of these different types of notes. **Fleeting notes** are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else. When you are in a conversation, listing to a lecture, hear something noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are running errands, a quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing. 

>It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. They will very soon become completely useless – unless you do something with them. **If you already know that you will not go back to them, don’t take these kind of notes in the first place. Take proper notes instead.**

>Fleeting notes are only useful if you **review them within a day or so** and **turn them into proper notes you can use later.** Fleeting literature notes can make sense if you need an **extra step to understand or grasp an idea**, but they will not help you in the later stages of **the writing process**, as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument.

>Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.

>**Most ideas will not stand the test of time**, while others might become the seed for a major project. Unfortunately, they are not easy to distinguish right away. That is why the threshold to write an idea down has to be as low as possible, but it is **equally crucial to elaborate on them within a day or two.** A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is **when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal**. In the first case, you forgot what it was supposed to **remind you of**. In the second case, you **forgot the context** that gave it its meaning.

>The only **permanently stored notes** are **the literature notes in the reference system** and **the main notes in the slip-box.** The former can be very brief as the context is clearly the text they refer to. The latter need be written with more care and details as they need to be self-explanatory.

>But before he stored them away, he would read what he noted down during the day, think about its relevance for his own lines of thought and write about it, filling his main slip-box with permanent notes.

>In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is **elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece**, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments.

>It is the standardised format that enables the notes to build up a critical mass in one place.

>The last type of note, the ones that are related to only one specific project, are kept together with other project-related notes in a project-specific folder. It doesn’t matter in which format these notes are as they are going to end up in the bin after the project is finished anyway (or in an archive – the bin for the indecisive).

>Project-related notes can be:
> ·  comments in the manuscript
> ·  collections of project-related literature
> ·  outlines
> ·  snippets of drafts
> ·  reminders
> ·  to-do lists
> ·  and of course the draft itself.

>The Zettelkasten has the built-in function of project-specific desktops. Here, you can not only structure your thoughts and conceptualise the chapters of your draft, but also collect and sort the notes for this specific project without fear that they will water down or interfere with the slip-box itself. You can even change the notes according to your project without affecting the notes in the slip-box.
