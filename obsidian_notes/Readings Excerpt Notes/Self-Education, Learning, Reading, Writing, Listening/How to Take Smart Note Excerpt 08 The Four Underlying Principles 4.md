## The Four Underlying Principles

### 8 Let the Work Carry You Forward

>You may remember from school the difference between an exergonic and an endergonic reaction.

>Sometimes we feel like our work is draining our energy and we can only move forward if we put more and more energy into it. But sometimes it is the opposite. Once we get into the workflow, it is as if the work itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us. This is the kind of dynamic we are looking for.

>A good **workflow** can easily turn into a **virtuous circle,** where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy the work, and so on.

>Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards (like doing something nice after finishing a chapter) are only **short-term solutions** with no prospect of **establishing a positive feedback loop.** These are very **fragile motivational constructions.** Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward.

>**Feedback loops** are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also **the key element to any learning process.** Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. And the only chance to improve in something is getting timely and concrete feedback. Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn. ... To **actively seek and welcome feedback**, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for **success (and happiness) in the long run.** Conversely, nothing is a bigger hindrance to personal growth than having a “fixed mindset.”

>Those who fear and avoid feedback because it might damage their cherished positive self-image might feel better in the short term, but will quickly fall behind in actual performance

>Having been praised for what they are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure.

>**Embracing a growth mindset** means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding).

>To seek as many opportunities to learn as possible is the most reliable long-term growth strategy. And if growth and success are not reasons enough, then maybe the fact that **the fear of failure** has the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia.

>Having a growth mindset is crucial, but only one side of the equation. **Having a learning system** in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important.... The linear model of academic writing comes with very few feedback opportunities,...If you choose a topic for your paper and work according to the linear model, you will only learn if your choice was wise after multiple stages of research. The same applies to the question of if you understood what you read and if your idea for an argument makes sense.

>Following a circular approach, on the other hand, allows you to **implement many feedback loops**, which give you the chance to improve your work while you are working on it. It is not just about increasing the number of opportunities to learn, but also to be able to correct the mistakes we inevitably make. As the feedback loops are usually smaller than one big chunk of feedback at the end, they are also much less scary and easier to embrace.

>The ability to express understanding **in one’s own words** is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes – and only by doing it with the chance of **realizing our lack of understanding** can we become better at it. But the better we become, the easier and quicker we can make notes, which again increases the number of learning experiences. The same applies to the crucial ability to **distinguish the important bits of a text from the less important ones**: the better we become at it, the more effective our reading will become, the more we can read, the more we will learn. We will enter a beautiful, virtuous circle of competency. You cannot help but feel motivated by it.

>The same goes for **writing permanent notes**, which have another **feedback loop** built-in: **Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if we really thought them through.** The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, **the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions.** 

>While these built-in feedback loops do not make redundant the **feedback from your peers or supervisor**, they are the only ones that are always available and can help us to improve a little bit, multiple times every single day. And the best thing about this is that **while we learn and become better, our slip-box becomes more knowledgeable too.** It grows and improves. And the more it grows, the more useful it becomes and the easier it will be for us to make new connections.

>The slip-box is **not a collection of notes**. Working with it is less about **retrieving specific notes** and more about **being pointed to relevant facts** and **generating insight** by **letting ideas mingle.** Its **usability** grows with its size, **not just linearly but exponentially.** When we turn to the slip-box, its **inner connectedness** will not just provide us with isolated facts, but with lines of developed thoughts. Moreover, because of its **inner complexity**, a search thought the slip-box will confront us with related notes we did not look for.

>Our brains work not that differently in terms of **interconnectedness**. ... the more connected information we already have, the easier it is to learn, because **new information** can dock to that information. ... our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if **facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion**, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes **easier to make sense of new information.** That makes it easier not only to **learn and remember**, but also to **retrieve the information** later in the moment and context it is needed.
