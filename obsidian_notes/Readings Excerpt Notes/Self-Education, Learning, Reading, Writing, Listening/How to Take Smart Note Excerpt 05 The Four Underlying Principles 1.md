## The Four Underlying Principles

### 5 Writing Is the Only Thing That Matters

>This book is based on another assumption: Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research. Nobody starts from scratch and everybody is already able to think for themselves. Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. 

>There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. **An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.** And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas.

>the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And **truth** is always a public matter.

>The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth. The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, **regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher**: They have to be *coherent and based on facts.* Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas.

>Working as if nothing else counts than writing does not mean spending more time writing at the expense of everything else.... it does not mean to read less, for this is the main source of the writing material. It doesn’t mean to attend fewer lectures or seminars, because they provide you with the ideas to write about and questions worth answering.

>**Focusing on writing** also doesn’t mean to stop giving presentations or finding other ways of making your thoughts public. Where else could you get feedback for your ideas?

>**Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts** does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently.

>***Having a clear, tangible purpose** when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and **sharpen your focus.*** You will not waste your time with the attempt to figure out what you “should” learn. Rather, you will try to learn as efficiently as possible so you can quickly get to the point where **actual open questions arise**, as these are the only questions worth writing about. You quickly learn to distinguish good-sounding arguments from actual good ones, as you will have to think them through **whenever you try to write them down and *connect* them with your previous knowledge.**

>It will change the way you *read* as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything. You will read in a more **engaged way**, because you cannot **rephrase** anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about. By doing this, you will **elaborate on the meaning, which will make it much more likely that you will *remember* it.**

>You also have to think beyond the things you read, because you need to turn it into something new. And by doing everything with **the clear purpose of writing about it**, you will do what you do ***deliberately***. ***Deliberate practice** is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing.*

>Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing.
