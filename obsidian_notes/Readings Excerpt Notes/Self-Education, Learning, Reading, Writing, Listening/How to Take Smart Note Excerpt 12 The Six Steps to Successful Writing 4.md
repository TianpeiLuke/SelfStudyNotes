## The Six Steps to Successful Writing

### 12 Develop Ideas

>Ideally, new notes are written with explicit reference to already existing notes. Obviously, this is not always possible, especially in the beginning when the slip-box is still in its infancy, but it will very soon become the first option most of the time. Then you can put the new note “behind” an existing, related note straight away. 

>If the existing note bore the number 21, he numbered the new note 22. If note number 22 already existed, he would still add it behind 21, but number it 21a. By alternating numbers and letters, he was able to branch out into an infinite number of sequences and sub-sequences internally with no hierarchical order.

>The digital Zettelkasten makes things easier: numbers are assigned automatically, note sequences can be constructed any time later and one note can become the follow-up note to different notes at the same time.

>These note sequences are the backbone of text development. They combine the advantages of an abstract with a topic-related order. 

>Because the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopaedia, but a tool to think with, we don’t need to worry about completeness. **We don’t need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence. We only write if it helps us with our own thinking.** 

>As the slip-box is not a book with just one topic, **we don’t need to have an overview of it.** On the contrary, we are much better off accepting as early as possible that an overview of the slip-box is as impossible as having an overview of our own thinking **while we are thinking.** As an extension of our own memory, the slip-box is the medium we **think in**, not something we **think about.** The note sequences are the clusters where order emerges from complexity. We extract information from different linear sources and mix it all up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patterns into new linear texts.

#### 12.1 Develop Topics

>After adding a note to the slip-box, we need to make sure it can be found again. This is what the index is for. Luhmann wrote an index with a typewriter on index cards. 

> In the Zettelkasten, **keywords** can easily be added to a note like tags and will then show up in the index. They should be chosen carefully and sparsely. 

>Luhmann would add the number of one or two (rarely more) notes next to a keyword in the index (Schmidt 2013, 171). The reason he was so **economical with notes per keyword** and why we too should be very **selective** lies in the way the slip-box is used. Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as **a system to think with**, **the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note**. Focusing exclusively on the index would basically mean that we always know upfront what we are looking for – we would have to have a fully developed plan in our heads. But **liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place.**

>This crucial element of surprise comes into play on the level of the interconnected notes, not when we are looking for particular entries in the index. 

>The organisation of the notes is in the network of references in the slip-box, so all we need from the index are **entry points**. 

>**A few wisely chosen notes are sufficient for each entry point.** The quicker we get from the index to the concrete notes, the quicker we move our attention from **mentally preconceived ideas towards the fact-rich level of interconnected content**, where we can conduct a fact-based dialogue with the slip-box.

>The consideration of **how to structure a topic**, therefore, belongs on notes as well – and **not on a meta-hierarchical level**. We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid) **overview over a topic** or subtopic just by **making another note**. If we then **link from the index to such a note, we have a good entry point.** If the overview on this note ceases to correctly represent the state of a cluster or topic, or we decide it should be structured differently, we can write a new note with a better structure and update the respective link from the index. This is important: **Every consideration on the structure of a topic is just another consideration on a note – bound to change and dependent on the development of our understanding.**

>The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an *archivist* or a *writer*. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: **In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it?** It is a crucial difference.

>**Keywords** should always be assigned with **an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in**, **never by looking at the note in isolation.** This is also why this process cannot be automated or delegated to a machine or program – it requires thinking. 

>Good keywords are usually not already mentioned as words in the note.

>**Assigning keywords** is much more than just a bureaucratic act. It is a crucial part of the **thinking process**, which often leads to a deeper elaboration of the note itself and the connection to other notes

#### 12.2 Make Smart Connections

>Luhmann used four basic types of cross-references in his file-box ... Only the first and last are relevant for the digital Zettelkasten, the other two are merely compensating for restrictions of the analogue pen and paper version. You don’t need to concern yourself with them if you use the digital program.

>1. The first type of links are those on notes that are giving you **the overview of a topic**. These are notes directly referred to from **the index** and usually used as an **entry point** into a topic that has already developed to such a degree that an overview is needed or at least becomes helpful. On a note like this, you can collect **links to other relevant notes to this topic or question**, preferably with a short indication of what to find on these notes (one or two words or a short sentence is sufficient). This kind of note helps to structure thoughts and can be seen as an in-between step towards the development of a manuscript. Above all, they help **orientate** oneself **within the slip-box.** 

>What we think is relevant for a topic and what is not depends on our current understanding and should be taken quite seriously: **It defines an idea as much as the facts it is based on.** What we regard as being relevant for a topic and how we structure it will **change over time**. This change might lead to **another note** with a different, more adequate topic structure, which then can be seen as a comment on the previous note. 

>All we have to do is to **change the entry in the index to this new note and/or indicate on the old note that we now consider a new structure more fitting.**

>2. A similar though less crucial kind of link collection is on those notes that give an overview of a local, physical cluster of the slip-box. This is only necessary if you work with pen and paper like Luhmann.

> 3. Equally less relevant for the digital version are those links that indicate the note to which the current note is a follow-up and those links that indicate the note that follows on the current note.

>4. The most common form of reference is plain note-to-note links. ... By linking two related notes regardless of where they are within the slip-box or within different contexts, surprising new lines of thought can be established. 

>These links can help us to find surprising connections and similarities between seemingly unrelated topics. Patterns might not become visible right away, but they might emerge after multiple note-to-note links between two topics have been established. 


>It is important to always keep in mind that making these links is not a chore, a kind of file-box maintenance. **The search for meaningful connections is a crucial part of the thinking process towards the finished manuscript.** But here, it is dealt with in a very concrete way. Instead of figuratively searching our internal memory, we literally **go through the file-box and look for connections.** By dealing with actual notes, we are also less prone to imagine connections where there aren’t any, as we can see in black and white if something makes sense or not.

>While this structure builds up externally and independently of our limited memory, it will, in return, **shape our thinking** as well and help us to **think in a more structured way.** Our ideas will be rooted in a network of facts, thought-through ideas and verifiable references. 

#### 12.3 Compare, Correct and Differentiate

>If you use the slip-box for a while, you will inevitably make a sobering discovery: The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there. Even worse, chances are this idea wasn’t even yours, but someone else’s. 

>Sometimes, **the confrontation with old notes** helps to detect differences we wouldn’t have noticed otherwise. What seems to be the same idea sometimes turns out to be slightly, but crucially, different. We then can explicitly discuss this difference on another note. This is especially helpful when two authors use the same concept in slightly different ways. The clarification of differences in the use of words and concepts is a major part of every serious academic work anyway – but it is so much easier if you have a nit-picking partner like the slip-box. 

>If we had written just excerpts or notes that we had kept in separate places, these differences would only become obvious *if we had all the relevant notes on our minds at the same time.* It is much easier to detect these small but crucial differences when we literally **have our notes in front of our eyes, comparing them during our attempts to connect them.**

>It is much easier to **see differences and similarities** than to **detect** them by mere thinking

>Comparing notes also helps us to **detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions** – important facilitators for insight. When we realise that we **used to accept two contradicting ideas as equally true**, we know that we have a problem – and problems are good because we now have something to solve. A **paradox** can be a sign that we **haven’t thought thoroughly enough** about a problem or, conversely, that we **exhausted the possibilities of a certain paradigm**. Finally, **oppositions** help to shape ideas by providing **contrast.**

>The constant comparing of notes also serves as an **ongoing examination of old notes in a new light.** I am surprised how often the addition of one note leads to a correction, a complementation or an improvement of old ideas.

>The slip-box not only confronts us with dis-confirming information, but also helps with what is known as the **feature-positive effect** (Allison and Messick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971). This is the phenomenon in which we tend to **overstate the importance of information** that is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards **the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones.** 

>The slip-box constantly reminds us of information we have long forgotten and wouldn’t remember otherwise – so much so, we wouldn’t even look for it.


#### 12.4 Assemble a Toolbox for Thinking

>A **scientific term** or **concept** only becomes meaningful **within the context of a theory** – otherwise it would just be a word.

>Scientific work is much more pragmatic and less determined by theory than *outsiders* would expect (Latour and Woolgar 1979). At the same time, we use scientific knowledge and theories to make sense of our surroundings every day. And some theories or theoretical models are surprisingly versatile, which is why it makes sense to **assemble a toolbox of useful mental models** (Manktelow and Craik 2004) that could help with our daily challenges and make sense of the things we learn and encounter.

>**The importance is to have not just a few, but a broad range of mental models in your head.** Otherwise, you risk becoming too attached to one or two and see only what fits them. You would become the man with a hammer who sees nails everywhere. 

>A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to **make sense of things** by **drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes.** This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to **learn from experience.** It is much better to learn from the experiences of others – especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile “mental models” that can be used in different situations.

>When we **delegate the storage of knowledge to the slip-box** and at the same time focus on the **principles** behind an **idea** while we *write, add and connect notes*, when we **look for patterns** and **think beyond** the most obvious interpretation of a note, when we try to *make sense* of something, combine different ideas and develop lines of thought, we do exactly that: we build up a "**latticework of mental models**” instead of just “remembering isolated facts and try and bang ’em back.”

>The beauty of this approach is that we co-evolve with our slip-boxes: we build the same connections in our heads while we deliberately develop them in our slip-box – and make it easier to remember the facts as they now have a latticework we can attach them to. 

> We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (**elaboration**), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (**spacing**) in different contexts (**variation**), ideally with the help of chance (**contextual interference**) and with a deliberate effort (**retrieval**). The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn in this proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by using it.



#### 12.5 Use the Slip-Box as a Creativity Machine

>Being experienced with a **problem** and intimately familiar with **the tools and devices** we work with, ideally to the point of **virtuosity**, is the precondition for discovering their inherent possibilities. ... This is especially true for the use of a slip-box. It is the intuition that comes from the **intimate knowledge of a practice** that can lead us to new insights.

>Steven Johnson, who wrote an insightful book about how people in science and in general come up with genuine new ideas, calls it the **“slow hunch.”** As a precondition to make use of this intuition, he emphasises the importance of **experimental spaces where ideas can freely mingle**. 

>Most often, innovation is not the result of a sudden moment of realization, anyway, but **incremental steps toward improvement**. ... This is why **the search for small differences is key.** It is such an important skill to see differences between seemingly similar concepts, or connections between seemingly different ideas.

>To **have concrete notes in front of our eyes** and be able to **compare them directly makes differences**, even small ones, much easier to spot. 


#### 12.6 Think Inside the Box

>Comparing, differentiating and connecting notes are the basis of good academic writing, but **playing and tinkering with ideas** is what leads to insight and exceptional texts.

>To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of **abstraction and re-specification**. ... Abstraction should indeed not be the final goal of thinking, but it is a necessary in-between step to make heterogeneous ideas compatible. ... Only by abstraction and re-specification can we apply ideas in the singular and always different situations in reality (Loewenstein, 2010).

>Studies on creativity with engineers show that *the ability to find not only **creative**, but **functional and working solutions** for technical problems* is equal to the ability to make abstractions. .. Abstraction is also the key to **analyse and compare concepts**, to **make analogies** and to **combine ideas**; this is especially true when it comes to **interdisciplinary work** (Goldstone and Wilensky 2008).

>Here, it is **the concrete standardization of notes** in just one format that enables us to literally shuffle them around, to add one idea to multiple contexts and to compare and combine them in a creative way without losing sight of what they truly contain.

>The real enemy of independent thinking is not an external authority, but our own inertia. The ability to **generate new ideas** has more to do with **breaking with old habits of thinking** than with coming up with as many ideas as possible. 

>I do not recommend “thinking outside the box”. On the contrary, we can turn the slip-box into a tool for breaking out of our own thinking habits

>Our brains just love **routines**. Before new information prompts our brains to **think differently** about something, they make the new information fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception. We need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking routines. In their book with the showy title “**The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking**”, the mathematicians Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbird collected different strategies to do that (2012). Some are already technically implemented in the slip-box, others are good to keep in mind.
>
>For example, they emphasise the importance of **feedback loops** and the need to find ways to **confront ourselves with our errors, mistakes and misunderstandings**. This is a **built-in feature of the slip-box**. Another habit of the effective thinkers they highlight is their ability to **focus on the main ideas** behind the details, to grasp the **gist** of something. This, too, is something the **slip-box nudges us to do**.
>
>Another piece of advice is not a feature of the slip-box and might sound banal, but it is crucial: **Make sure that you really see what you think you see and describe it as plainly and factually as possible**. ...
>
>... To really understand a text is therefore a constant revision of our first interpretation. 
>
>...It is very good to know what has already proven to not work if we try to come up with new ideas that do work.
>
.One possibility to deal with this tendency is to ask counterfactual questions, like “what if?” 



#### 12.7 Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions

>The slip-box imposes quite **a few restrictions** on its user. Instead of having the choice between all kinds of fancy notebooks, papers or writing formats, or being able to employ the whole range of productivity tools available for note-taking, learning and academic or nonfiction writing, everything is reduced to **a single plain-text format** and collected **in a single simple slip-box system** with no frills or features.

>By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just **one idea per note** and force ourselves to be **as precise and brief as possible**. 

>**Standardised** is also the way we treat **literature** and our own **thoughts**: Instead of using different kinds of notes or techniques for different kinds of texts or ideas, the approach here is always **the same, simple one**. Literature is condensed on a note saying, “On page x, it says y,” and later stored with the reference in one place. Ideas and thoughts are captured on the slip-box notes and connected to other notes always in the same way in the same place. **These standardizations make it possible that the technical side of note-taking can become automatic.** 

>not having to make decisions can be quite liberating. ... less choice can not only increase our productivity, but also our freedom and make it easier to be in the moment and enjoy it (Schwartz, 2007). 

>A clear **structure** allows us to explore the internal possibilities of something. 

>The biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore the opposite: **a lack of structure and restrictions**. 

>And the slipbox is, above all, **a tool for enforcing distinctions, decisions and making differences visible**.
