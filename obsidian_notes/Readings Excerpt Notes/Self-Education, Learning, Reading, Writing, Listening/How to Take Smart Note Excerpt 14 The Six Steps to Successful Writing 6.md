## The Six Steps to Successful Writing

### 14 Make It a Habit

>The most reliable predictor of our behaviour in the immediate future is – surprise, surprise – the **intention** to do it.

>When it comes to the long run, researchers struggle to find any measurable connection between our intentions and our actual behaviour. There is one **exception**, though: we most certainly act according to our intention if we happen to intend to do exactly what we used to do before.

>We have the best chance to change our behaviour over the long term if we start with a realistic idea about the difficulties of behavioural change (Dean 2013).

>The trick is **not to try to break with old habits** and also **not to use willpower** to force oneself to do something else, but to strategically **build up new habits** that have a chance to replace the old ones. 

>The goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects.

>If we manage to establish a routine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box.
