## Book Excerpt

##### Introduction

>it is not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in the way they do their everyday work.

- Summary: Connect to Atomic Habit and the compound effect on people's life

##### 1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected

Topic: This section motivates a change of behavior on note-taking. 

>- There is no need to build a complex system and there is no need to reorganise everything you already have. You can start working and developing ideas immediately by taking smart notes.

> - Complexity is an issue, though. Even if you don’t aim to develop a grand theory and just want to keep track of what you read, organise your notes and develop your thoughts, you will have to deal with an increasingly complex body of content, especially because it is not just about collecting thoughts, but about making connections and sparking new ideas. Most people try to reduce complexity by separating what they have into smaller stacks, piles or separate folders. They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between the notes themselves, which means a trade-off between its **usability and usefulness.**

>- The second idea is equally important. Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, ... as soon as you get used to taking smart notes, it will feel so much more natural that you will wonder how you were ever able to get anything done before. ... Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place.  

- Summary: one way to achieve easy writing is to develop ideas continually through smart notes. Besides that, we need to develop ways to organize our notes so that it is easy to track and not too complicated, i.e. be useful and be usable.  Finally, we need to be form a habit of note-taking. Only when we build a system that makes note-taking being part of it, can we make significant changes on our life. 

> - The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001). 
>   
> - The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. 
>   
> - The principle is simple but holistic.... it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds.


> - __Unfortunately__, David Allen’s technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. 
>   
> * The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition. We usually start with rather vague ideas that are bound to change until they become clearer in the course of our research
>   
> * The other reason is that GTD requires projects to be broken down into smaller, concrete “next steps.” Of course, insightful writing or academic work is also done one step at a time, but these are most often too small to be worth writing down (looking up a footnote, rereading a chapter, writing a paragraph) or too grand to be finished in one go.
>   
> - Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks. It wouldn’t make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level.


> - What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent. ... Only if they are embedded in a well-conceived working process can the tools play out their strengths.

> - That is why we need a note-taking system that is as comprehensive as GTD, but one that is suitable for the open-ended process of writing, learning and thinking. 

- Summary: GTD method by David Allen provides a good framework that emphasizes the process of collecting everything of concern in one place. But GTD cannot be directly used in research and writing since it requires clear definition of objective which is hardly the case in early phase of research. Moreover, research and writing are nonlinear process, which requires back-and-forth with multiple tasks simultaneously. Thus the "next action" focus of GTD is not suited. Nonetheless, GTD methodology motivates us to build a holistic working process that collects all information that needed for research, writing etc. The Zettelkastan Method (Slip Box) is a holistic system of note-taking, thinking and researching.
