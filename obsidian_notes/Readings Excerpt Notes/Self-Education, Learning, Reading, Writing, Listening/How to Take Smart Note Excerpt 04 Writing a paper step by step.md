## Book Excerpt

##### 2.1 Writing a paper step by step

>**1. Make fleeting notes.** Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. *Don’t worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on*. These are fleeting notes, **mere reminders** of what is in your head. They should not cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your **inbox**, and process them later. 

>If your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent note for your slip-box.

>**2. Make literature notes.** Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. **Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words**. Be extra selective with quotes – **don’t copy them** to skip the step of really understanding what they mean. Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system.

>**3. Make permanent notes.** Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and **think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.** ... The idea is not to collect, but **to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.** Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?

>Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: **Use full sentences**, **disclose your sources,** **make references** and try to be as **precise, clear and brief** as possible. Throw away the fleeting notes from step one and put the literature notes from step two into your reference system. You can forget about them now. All that matters is going into the slip-box.

>**4. Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box** by:
> a) Filing each one behind one or more related notes. Look to which note the new one directly relates or, if it does not relate directly to any other note yet, just file it behind the last one.
> b) Adding links to related notes.
> c) Making sure you will be able to find this note later by *either linking to it from your index* or by *making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index*.

>**5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system.** See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. 

>Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about. Take more notes, develop ideas further and see where things will take you. 

>Just **follow your interest** and always take the path that promises the most insight. *Build upon what you have.* Even if you don’t have anything in your slip-box yet, you never start from scratch – you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered.

>**Do not brainstorm for a topic**. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters. Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum. 

>The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it. 

>**6. After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about.** Your topic is now based on what you have, not based on an unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read might provide.

>Don’t wait until you have everything together. Rather, try ideas out and give yourself enough time to go back to reading and note-taking to improve your ideas, arguments and their structure.

>**7. Turn your notes into a rough draft.** ... *Translate* them into something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes at the same time. Detect holes in your argument, fill them or change your argument.

>**8. Edit and proofread your manuscript.** Give yourself a pat on the shoulder and turn to the next manuscript.


>In reality, you never work on just one idea, but many ideas in different stages at the same time. And that is where the system plays out its real strengths. 

>We cannot help but think about more than one question at a time and the chances are that you will think and write in the future as well. It might not be for academia or a publication, but certainly for your own intellectual growth. 

>Gather what you encounter along your way and don’t let any good idea go to waste. You might read a certain book in hope it could be useful for one of the papers you write. Maybe you are wrong, but it still might contain some interesting thoughts worth keeping and useful for something else you haven’t thought about yet.


>You read and take notes. You build connections within the slip-box, which in itself will spark new ideas. You write them down and add them to the discussion. You write on your paper, notice a hole in the argument and have another look in the file system for the missing link. You follow up on a footnote, go back to research and might add a fitting quote to one of your papers in the making.
