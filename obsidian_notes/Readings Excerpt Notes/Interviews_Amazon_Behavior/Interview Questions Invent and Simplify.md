## Principle

>[!quote]
>Leaders expect and require **innovation** and invention from their teams and always find ways to **simplify**. They are **externally aware**, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited to "*not invented here*." As we **do new things**, we accept that we may be *misunderstood* for long periods of time.

## Questions

>[!question]
> Choose 2–3 questions below for your interview:
> 
> 1. Give me an example of a complex problem you solved with a simple solution. What made the problem complex? How do you know your solution addressed the problem?
> 2. Describe the **most innovative thing** you’ve done and why you thought it was innovative. Ask for one or two more examples to see if it's a pattern of innovative thinking. What was the problem it was solving? What was innovative about it?
> 3. Tell me about a time when you were able to make something **simpler for customers**. What drove you to implement this change? What was the impact?
> 4. Describe a time when you **influenced** and **drove new thinking** and **innovation** out of your team. Give an example of how your approach led to a specific innovation.
> 5. Tell me about a time when you had a **challenging** problem or situation that the usual approach wouldn't address. How did you select an alternative approach? What alternative approach(es) did you consider? What was the end result? What was the impact?
> 6. Tell me about a novel idea you had or decision you made that had a big impact on your business. What was novel about it?
> 7. Tell me about a time when you identified a simple change on your team to make the culture more inclusive. What problem were you trying to solve, what was the outcome? (DEI)
