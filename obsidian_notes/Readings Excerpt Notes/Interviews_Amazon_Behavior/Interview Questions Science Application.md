>**The science (AS/RS) job families cast a wide net across different fields. It is paramount to identify the potential areas of candidate depth through a phone screen in order to assign the proper interviewer for Science Depth.**

## Science Application

>[!quote]
> An important science skill is the ability to deal with *ambiguous and ill-defined problems* as projects are seldom strictly and precisely defined from the beginning; we often have to work with the *business stakeholders* to **clarify** and **set** the appropriate **goals**. To demonstrate this ability, a candidate should be able to **productively discuss** a problem that is *slightly underspecified* at first by the interviewer. The candidate should be able to **ask clarification questions**, **reason about the missing pieces of information**, and **progress** towards a **solution or model** to the problem. Although dealing with ambiguity is not an LP, please assess and document the candidate's **ability to work with ambiguity** from a research/modeling perspective. For AS/RS, possible approaches to assess this competency include:
> 
> - **Applied Science:** Provide a *hypothetical real-world problem* and ask the candidate to *articulate how they would solve*. It's recommended to assign a somewhat ill-defined and ambiguous problem. 
> - **Research Science**: Solve a modeling problem; provided the general dynamics (e.g., Overbooking Problem-Amazon Locker Team, Import Buy Problem-Amazon EOM Team, Order Assignment problem–Amazon F2P Team, Data Analysis problem–Simpson’s Paradox) and ask the candidate build a decision making/analysis mathematical model.

## Criteria

>[!quote]
>The candidate should be able to **productively discuss** a problem which is slightly **underspecified** at first. 
>
>They should be able to 
>- **ask clarification questions**, 
>- reason about the *missing* pieces of information, 
>- and *progress* towards a Machine Learning-based solution to the problem. 
>
>Keeping in mind that this competency aims to specifically test the ability of the candidate to **work with ambiguity** from a research/modeling perspective, 
>
>I plan to talk about a product our team launched a few years ago, namely Secure Delivery, and ask the candidate to help set up a solution to recommend signature on delivery for high-abuse risk orders. I would consider it as “bar raising” if the candidate can solve the problem at hand in a Machine Learning driven way and can take me from the variable creation step all the way to the model building and model performance assessment step; a “nice to have” would be if the candidate is able to also discuss the challenges of maintaining a model in production, but not needed at the L4 level.
