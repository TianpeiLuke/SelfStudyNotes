## Principle

>[!quote]
>Leaders operate at all levels, stay **connected** to the **details**, **audit** frequently, and are **skeptical** when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.

## Criteria

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                  |           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |              |

## Questions

>[!question]
>Choose 2–3 questions below for your interview. 
> 
> 1. Tell me about a time when you were trying to understand a complex problem on your team and you had to **dig into the details** to figure it out. **Who** did you talk with or **where** did you have to look to find the most valuable information? How did you use that information to help solve the problem?
> 2. Tell me about a situation that required you to dig deep to get to the **root cause**. How did you know you were focusing on the right things? What was the outcome? Would you have done anything differently?  
>     
> 3. Tell me about a problem you had to solve that required in-depth thought and analysis. How did you know you were focusing on the right things? What was the outcome? Would you have done anything differently?
> 4. Walk me through a **big problem** or issue in your organization that **you helped to solve**. How did you become aware of it? What **information** did you gather? What information was missing and how did **you fill the gaps**? Did you do a reflection at the conclusion of the project? If so, what did you learn?
> 5. Tell me about a specific metric you have used to identify a need for a change in your department. Did you create the metric or was it already available? How did this and other information influence the change? What was the outcome of this change?
> 6. Have you ever created a metric that helped identify a need for a change in your department? What was the metric? Why did you create it? How did this and other information influence change? What was the outcome of the change?
> 7. Tell me about a time when you had to validate the assumptions underlying a direct report's project. How did you decide follow up was necessary? What steps, if any, did you take to validate the assumptions? What was the result? (Manager)
> 8. Tell me about a time when you sought diverse perspectives to evaluate the assumptions underlying a direct report's project**.** How did you ensure that you were being inclusive in your review? (Manager) (DEI)
