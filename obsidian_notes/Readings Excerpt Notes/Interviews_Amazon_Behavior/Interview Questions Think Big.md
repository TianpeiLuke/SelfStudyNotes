## Principle

>[!quote]
>Thinking small is a **self-fulfilling prophecy**. Leaders create and communicate a **bold direction** that inspires results. They **think differently** and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

## Criteria

>Choose 2–3 questions below for your interview:
>
> 1. Tell me about time when you were working on an initiative or goal and saw an opportunity to do something much bigger or better than the initial focus. Did you take that opportunity? Why or why not? What was the outcome?
> 2. Give me an example of how you have changed the direction or view of a specific function/department and helped them embrace a new way of thinking. Why was a change needed? What was the outcome?
> 3. Give me an example of a time you proposed a novel approach to a problem. What was the problem and why did it require a novel approach? Was your approach successful?
> 4. Tell me about a time when you drove adoption for your vision/ideas. How did you know your vision/idea was adopted by others? How did you drive adoption for your vision/ideas? How did you track adoption? Would you do anything differently?
