## Principle

>[!quote]
>The candidate should demonstrate **mastery** in their particular *area of expertise*. 

## Criteria

>[!quote]
> Note that for **Science Depth**, we should let the candidate tell us *what their Science Depth domain* is and not impose a topic of discussion (different from Science Application and Science Breadth where the interview leads the discussion topics). 
> 
> The candidate should be able to 
> - identify **methodological tradeoffs**, 
> - contextualize solutions with respect to classic and current research, and 
> - be familiar with the "art" of developing solutions within their area. 
> 
> Ideally, they have a publication record in this area, even at the L4 level. 
> - I would consider it as “bar raising” if the candidate can discuss in depth about **different approaches** in the domain of expertise, 
> - *contrast them*, 
> - *share* about deep dives in hands-on projects using these techniques, 
> - and clearly articulate about *state-of-the-art research* in that space with the interviewer, even if the interview is not an expert in this domain. 
> - The difference in bar between L4, L5, and L6 if the **depth of understanding/depth** that the candidate can bring to the discussion.
