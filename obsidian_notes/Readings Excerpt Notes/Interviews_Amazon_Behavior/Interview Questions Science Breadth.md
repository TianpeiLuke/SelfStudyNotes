## Principle

>[!quote]
>The candidate should demonstrate **working knowledge** of standard methods used in their *respective scientific discipline*. 


## Criteria

>[!quote]
> For L4 candidates, the **Science Breadth** bar is relaxed and emphasis should be placed on core areas, i.e., 
>- (1) Binary classifiers, 
>- (2) Ensembles: Boosting/Bagging/Stacking/Cascading, and 
>- (3) Model performanceÂ evaluation/metrics and selection); other areas are covered, but as additional data.
>
>A good indicator for suitable breadth is the ability to 
>1) discuss **widely covered concepts/methods** in pertinent graduate-level university courses and 
>2) **apply** these methods to building a working, scalable system. 
>3) In other words, try to understand if the candidate is comfortable **contrasting different approaches** to solve a unique modeling problem.
