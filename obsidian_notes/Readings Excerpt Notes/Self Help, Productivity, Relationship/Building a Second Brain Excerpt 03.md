# PART TWO - The Method: The Four Steps of CODE
## Chapter 4: Capture—Keep What Resonates

>A Second Brain gives us a way to filter the information stream and curate only the very best ideas we encounter in a private, trusted place.

### Building a Private Collection of Knowledge

>Talent needs to be channeled and developed in order to become something more than a momentary spark. 

>Think about your favorite athlete, musician, or actor. Behind the scenes of their public persona, there is a process they follow for regularly turning new ideas into creative output. The same goes for inventors, engineers, and effective leaders. Innovation and impact don’t happen by accident or chance. *Creativity depends on a creative process.*

### Creating a Knowledge Bank: How to Generate Compounding Interest from Your Thoughts

>Knowing how they were going to be putting ideas to use gave them a powerful lens for seeing which ones were worth the trouble of writing down.

>What kinds of information are worth preserving when we don’t know exactly how we’ll be putting it to use? Our world changes much faster than in previous eras, and most of us don’t have a single creative medium we work in. How can we decide what to save when we have no idea what the future holds?
>
>To answer that question, we have to radically expand our definition of “knowledge.”
>
>Knowledge isn’t just wise quotations from long-dead Greek philosophers in white togas. It’s not just the teachings found within thick textbooks written by academics with advanced degrees. In the digital world we live in, knowledge most often shows up as “content”—snippets of text, screenshots, bookmarked Knowledge isn’t just wise quotations from long-dead Greek philosophers in white togas. It’s not just the teachings found within thick textbooks written by academics with advanced degrees. In the digital world we live in, knowledge most often shows up as “content”—snippets of text, screenshots, bookmarked

>Knowledge capture is about mining the richness of the reading you’re already doing and the life you’re already living.

>knowledge asset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience.

> Knowledge assets can come from either the external world or your inner thoughts. *External knowledge* could include: 
> - Highlights: Insightful passages from books or articles you read. 
> - Quotes: Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to. 
> - Bookmarks and favorites: Links to interesting content you find on the web or favorited social media posts. 
> - Voice memos:Clips recorded on your mobile device as “notes to self.” 
> - Meeting notes: Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls. 
> - Images: Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting.
> - Takeaways: Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve attended.

> As you start collecting this material from the outer world, it often sparks *new ideas and realizations in your inner world.* You can capture those thoughts too! They could include: 
> - Stories: Your favorite anecdotes, whether they happened to you or someone else.
> - Insights: The small (and big) realizations you have. 
> - Memories: Experiences from your life that you don’t want to forget. 
> - Reflections: Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary. 
> - Musings: Random “shower ideas” that pop into your head.

> The meaning of a thought, insight, or memory often isn’t immediately clear. We need to write them down, revisit them, and view them from a different perspective in order to digest what they mean to us. It is exceedingly difficult to do that within the confines of our heads. We need an external medium in which to see our ideas from another vantage point, and writing things down is the most effective and convenient one ever invented


### What *Not* to Keep

> In my experience, there are four kinds of content that aren’t well suited to notes apps: 
> - Is this sensitive information you’d like to keep secure? The content you save in your notes is easily accessible from any device, which is great for accessibility but not for security. Information like tax records, government documents, passwords, and health records shouldn’t be saved in your notes. 
> - Is this a special format or file type better handled by a dedicated app? Although you could save specialized files such as Photoshop files or video footage in your notes, you’ll need a specialized app to open them anyway, so there’s no benefit to keeping them in your notes. 
> - Is this a very large file? Notes apps are made for short, lightweight bits of text and images, and their performance will often be severely hampered if you try to save large files in them. 
> - Will it need to be collaboratively edited? Notes apps are perfectly suited for individual, private use, which makes them less than ideal for collaboration. You can share individual notes or even groups of notes with others, but if you need multiple people to be able to collaboratively edit a document in real time, then you’ll need to use a different platform.


### Twelve Favorite Problems: A Nobel Prize Winner’s Approach to Capturing

> You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”


> Ask yourself, “What are the questions I’ve always been interested in?” This could include grand, sweeping questions like “How can we make society fairer and more equitable?” as well as practical ones like “How can I make it a habit to exercise every day?” It might include questions about relationships, such as “How can I have closer relationships with the people I love?” or productivity, like “How can I spend more of my time doing high-value work?” 
> 
> Here are more examples of favorite problems from my students:
> - How do I live less in the past, and more in the present?
> - How do I build an investment strategy that is aligned with my mid-term and long-term goals and commitments?
> - What does it look like to move from mindless consumption to mindful creation?
> - How can I go to bed early instead of watching shows after the kids go to bed?
> - How can my industry become more ecologically sustainable while remaining pro table?
> - How can I work through the fear I have of taking on more responsibility?
> - How can my school provide more resources for students with special needs?
> - How do I start reading all the books I already have instead of buying more?
> - How can I speed up and relax at the same time?
> - How can we make the healthcare system more responsive to people’s needs?
> - What can I do to make eating healthy easier?
> - How can I make decisions with more confidence?

>The key to this exercise is to make them *open-ended questions* that don’t necessarily have a single answer. To find questions that invoke a state of wonder and curiosity about the amazing world we live in.

>The power of your favorite problems is that they tend to stay fairly consistent over time. The exact framing of each question may change, but even as we move between projects, jobs, relationships, and careers, our favorite problems tend to follow us across the years. 


### Capture Criteria: How to Avoid Keeping Too Much (or Too Little)

>Once you have identified the kinds of questions you want your Second Brain to answer, it’s time to choose specifically which pieces of information will be most useful.

>Even if you spend the twenty or thirty minutes it would take to consume it now, in the future you’ll just have to spend all that time reading it again, since you’ll have forgotten most of the details. You also don’t want to just bookmark the link and save it to read later, because then you won’t know what it contains in the first place!

>This is where most people get stuck. They either dive straight into the first piece of content they see, read it voraciously, but quickly forget all the details, or they open dozens of tabs in their web browser and feel a pang of guilt at all those interesting resources they haven’t been able to get to.

>There is a way out of this situation. It starts with realizing that in any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you. When you realize this, the  answer is obvious. You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it as a succinct note.

>The best curators are picky about what they allow into their collections, and you should be too. With a notes app, you can always save links back to the original content if you need to review your sources or want to dive deeper into the details in the future.

>This is why it’s so important to take on a Curator’s Perspective—that we are the judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our lives. ... The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing it.

#### Capture Criteria #1: Does It Inspire Me?

>There is a way to evoke a sense of inspiration more regularly: keep a collection of inspiring quotes, photos, ideas, and stories. Any time you need a break, a new perspective, or a dash of motivation, you can look through it and see what sparks your imagination.

#### Capture Criteria #2: Is It Useful?

>Sometimes you come across a piece of information that isn’t necessarily inspiring, but you know it might come in handy in the future. 

#### Capture Criteria #3: Is It Personal?

>One of the most valuable kinds of information to keep is personal information —your own thoughts, reflections, memories, and mementos. 

>No one else has access to the wisdom you’ve personally gained from a lifetime of conversations, mistakes, victories, and lessons learned. No one else values the small moments of your days quite like you do
#### Capture Criteria #4: Is It Surprising?

>We have a natural bias as humans to seek evidence that confirms what we already believe, a well-studied phenomenon known as “confirmation bias."
>
>That isn’t what a Second Brain is for.

>Sometimes you come across an idea that is neither inspiring, personal, nor obviously useful, but there is something surprising about it. You may not be able to put your finger on why, but it conflicts with your existing point of view in a way that makes your brain perk up and pay attention. Those are the ideas you should capture.

>Our ability to capture ideas from anywhere takes us in a different direction: By saving ideas that may contradict each other and don’t necessarily support what we already believe, we can train ourselves to take in information from different sources instead of immediately jumping to conclusions. By playing with ideas—bending and stretching and remixing them—we become less attached to the way they were originally presented and can borrow certain aspects or elements to use in our own work.

### Ultimately, Capture What Resonates

>if you take away one thing from this chapter, it should be to keep what **resonates.**

>Here’s why: making decisions analytically, with a checklist, is taxing and stressful. It is the kind of thinking that demands the most energy. When you use up too much energy taking notes, you have little left over for the subsequent steps that add far more value: making connections, imagining possibilities, formulating theories, and creating new ideas of your own. Not to mention, if you make reading and learning into unpleasant experiences, over time you’re going to find yourself doing less and less of them. **The secret to making reading a habit is to make it effortless and enjoyable.**

>As you consume a piece of content, listen for an internal feeling of being moved or surprised by the idea you’re taking in. This special feeling of “resonance”—like an echo in your soul—is your intuition telling you that something is literally “noteworthy.”

>Just look for the signs: your eyes might widen slightly, your heart may skip a beat, your throat may go slightly dry, and your sense of time might subtly slow down as the world around you fades away. These are clues that it’s time to hit “save.”

>"Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without our conscious awareness."


### The Surprising Benefits of Externalizing Our Thoughts

>Not only does this allow you to preserve them for the long term; there are multiple other profound benefits that come from the simple act of writing something down.

>First, you are much more likely to remember information you’ve written down in your own words. 

>Enhancing our memory is just the beginning. When you express an idea in writing, it’s not just a matter of transferring the exact contents of your mind into paper or digital form. Writing creates new knowledge that wasn’t there before. Each word you write triggers mental cascades and internal associations, leading to further ideas, all of which can come tumbling out onto the page or screen.

>**Thinking doesn’t just produce writing; writing also enriches thinking.**

>In a wide range of controlled studies, writing about one’s inner experiences led to a drop in visits to the doctor, improved immune systems, and reductions in distress.

>Perhaps the most immediate benefit of capturing content outside our heads is that we escape what I call the “reactivity loop”—the hamster wheel of urgency, outrage, and sensationalism that characterizes so much of the Internet. *The moment you first encounter an idea is the worst time to decide what it means. You need to set it aside and gain some objectivity.*

>Notetaking is the easiest and simplest way of externalizing our thinking. ... Once our thoughts are outside our head, we can examine them, play with them, and make them better. It’s like a shortcut to realizing the full potential of the thoughts Мowing through our minds.


### Your Turn: What Would This Look Like If It Was Easy?

>What would capturing ideas look like if it was easy?

>It’s important to keep capturing relatively effortless because it is only the first step. You need to do it enough that it becomes second nature, while conserving your time and energy for the later steps when the value of the ideas you’ve found can be fully unleashed

>Capture isn’t about doing more. It’s about taking notes on the experiences you’re already having.

>Don’t worry about whether you’re capturing “correctly.” There’s no right way to do this, and therefore, no wrong way. 

>If at any point you feel stuck or overwhelmed, step back and remember that nothing is permanent in the digital world.
