## Reference

- Seek to Understand, then to Be Understood [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Chapter Summary 5]]

- Pros: This LP is against the following cognitive bias
	- [[Authority Bias]]
		- the tendency to *attribute greater accuracy* to the opinion of an *authority* figure (unrelated to its content) and be more influenced by that opinion.
	- [[Primacy Effect]]
		- Where an item *at the beginning* of a list is more easily recalled. A form of [serial position effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_position_effect "Serial position effect")
		- As a leader, avoid voicing your opinion first. Always ask membersâ€™ opinions in random order so that no one has an unfair advantage.
