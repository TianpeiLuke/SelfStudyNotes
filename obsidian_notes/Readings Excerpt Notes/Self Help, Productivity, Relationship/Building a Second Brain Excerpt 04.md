# PART TWO - The Method: The Four Steps of CODE

## Chapter 5: Organize—Save for Actionability

### The Cathedral Effect: Designing a Space for Your Ideas

>Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When we are in a space with high ceilings, for example—think of the lofty architecture of classic churches invoking the grandeur of heaven—we tend to think in more abstract ways. When we’re in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop, we’re more likely to think concretely.

>Your Second Brain isn’t just a tool—it’s an environment. It is a garden of knowledge full of familiar, winding pathways, but also secret and secluded corners. Every pathway is a jumping-oА point to new ideas and perspectives.

>Once you’ve created this environment, you’ll know where to go when it’s time to execute or create.


### Organizing for Action: Where 99 Percent of Notetakers Get Stuck (And How to Solve It)

>what to do with all this valuable material you’ve gathered. The more diligently you collect it, the bigger this problem will be! Capturing notes without an effective way to organize and retrieve them only leads to more overwhelm.

>The problem was that none of these systems was integrated into my daily life. They always required me to follow a series of elaborate rules that took time away from my other priorities, which meant they would quickly become outdated and obsolete. 

>I eventually named this organizing system **PARA**, which stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: **Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives**. These four categories are universal, encompassing any kind of information, from any source, in any format, for any purpose.

>PARA can handle it all, regardless of your profession or field, for one reason: **it organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is.** The project becomes the main unit of organization for your digital files. Instead of having to sort your notes according to a complex hierarchy of topics and subtopics, you have to answer only one simple question: **“In which project will this be most useful?”** It assumes only that you are currently working on a certain set of projects, and that your information should be organized to support them.

>If there isn’t a current project that your note would be useful for, we have a couple of other options of where to put it, including dedicated places for each of the main **“areas”** of your life that you are responsible for, and **“resources,”** which is like a **personal library of references, facts, and inspiration.** Over time, as you complete your projects, master new skills, and progress toward your goals, you’ll discover that some notes and resources are **no longer actionable**. I’ll show you how to move them to your **“archives”** to keep them out of sight but within easy reach.

>Instead of requiring tons of time meticulously organizing your digital world, PARA guides you in quickly sorting your ideas according to what really matters: **your goals.**

>One of the biggest temptations with organizing is to get too *perfectionistic*, treating the process of organizing as an end in itself. There is something inherently satisfying about order, and it’s easy to stop there instead of going on to develop and share our knowledge. We need to always be wary of **accumulating so much information that we spend all our time managing it, instead of putting it to use in the outside world.**

>PARA can be used everywhere, across any software program, platform, or notetaking tool. You can use the same system with the same categories and the same principles across your digital life.

>The intention here is not to use a single software program, but to use a single organizing system, one that provides consistency even as you switch between apps many times per day. 

### How PARA Works: Priming Your Mind (and Notes) for Action

> [!quote]
> With the PARA system, every piece of information you want to save can be
> placed into one of just four categories:
> 1. **Projects**: Short-term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on
> now.
> 2. **Areas**: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.
> 3. **Resources**: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.
> 4. **Archives**: Inactive items from the other three categories.

#### Projects: What I’m Working on Right Now

> Projects include the short-term outcomes you’re actively working toward right now.
> 
> Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize modern work. First, they **have a beginning and an end**; they take place during **a specific period of time** and then they **finish**. Second, they have **a specific, clear outcome that needs to happen** in order for them to be checked off as complete, such as “finalize,” “green-light,” “launch,” or “publish.”

>Knowing which projects you’re currently committed to is crucial to being able to prioritize your week, plan your progress, and say no to things that aren’t important.

#### Areas: What I’m Committed to Over Time

>As important as projects are, not everything is a project.

> In our work lives, we have various ongoing areas we’re responsible for, such as “product development,” “quality control,” or “human resources.” These are the **job responsibilities** that we were hired to take on. Sometimes there are others that we officially or unofficially have **taken ownership of over time**.

>Each of these is an example of **an area of responsibility**, and together they make up the second main category of PARA. All these areas, both personal and professional, require certain information to be handled effectively, but they’re not the same as projects.

> Examples of areas from your personal life could include:
> - Activities or places you are responsible for: Home/apartment; Cooking; Travel; Car.
> - People you are responsible for or accountable to: Friends; Kids; Spouse; Pets.
> - Standards of performance you are responsible for: Health; Personal growth; Friendships; Finances.
> 
> In your job or business:
> - Departments or functions you are responsible for: Account management; Marketing; Operations; Product development.
> - People or teams you are responsible for or accountable to: Direct reports; Manager; Board of directors; Suppliers.
> - Standards of performance you are responsible for: Professional development; Sales and marketing; Relationships and networking; Recruiting and hiring.
>   
> Even though areas have no final outcome, it is still important to manage
> them. In fact, if you look at the list above, these areas are critical to your health,
> happiness, security, and life satisfaction


>While there is no goal to reach, there is a **standard** that you want to uphold in each of these areas.

>Only you can decide what those standards are. For our purposes, **it helps tremendously to have a place dedicated to each of them.** That way you always have somewhere to put any thought, reflection, idea, or useful tidbit of information relevant to each important aspect of your life.

#### Resources: Things I Want to Reference in the Future

>The third category of information that we want to keep is resources. This is basically a catchall for anything that doesn’t belong to a project or an area and could include any topic you’re interested in gathering information about.
>
>For example:
> - What topics are you interested in? 
> - What subjects are you researching? 
> - What useful information do you want to be able to reference?
> - Which hobbies or passions do you have? 
> 
> Any one of these subjects could become its own resource folder. You can also
> think of them as “research” or “reference materials.”

>Any note or file that **isn’t relevant or actionable for a current project or area** can be placed into resources for future reference.

#### Archives: Things I’ve Completed or Put on Hold

> Finally, we have our archives. This includes any item from the previous three categories that is **no longer active.** For example:
> - Projects that are completed or canceled
> - Areas of responsibility that you are no longer committed to maintaining (such as when a relationship ends or after moving out of your apartment)
> - Resources that are no longer relevant (hobbies you lose interest in or subjects you no longer care about)

>The archives are an important part of PARA because they allow you to place a folder in “cold storage” so that it doesn’t clutter your workspace, while safekeeping it forever just in case you need it. 

> Unlike with your house or garage, there is no penalty for keeping digital stuff forever, as long as it doesn’t distract from your day-to-day focus. If you need access to that information in the future —for example, if you take on a project similar to one you previously completed —you can call it up within seconds.

### What PARA Looks Like: A Behind-the-Scenes Snapshot

>PARA is a universal system of organization designed to work across your digital world. It doesn’t work in only one place, requiring you to use completely different organizing schemes in each of the dozens of places you keep things. It can and should be used everywhere, such as the documents folder on your computer, your cloud storage drives, and of course, your digital notes app.

>That’s it—just three levels of hierarchy to encompass the thousands of notes I’ve accumulated over the years: the top-level PARA categories, the project folder, and the notes themselves


### Where Do I Put This?—How to Decide Where to Save Individual Notes

>Apps have made it extremely easy to capture content—it’s just a click or a tap away. However, we are given no guidance for what to do next. Where does a note go once it’s been created? What is the correct location for an incoming file? The more material piles up, the more urgent and stressful this problem becomes.

> The temptation when initially capturing notes is to also try to decide where they should go and what they mean. Here’s the problem: the moment you first capture an idea is the worst time to try to decide what it relates to. First, because you’ve just encountered it and haven’t had any time to ponder its ultimate purpose, but more importantly, because **forcing yourself to make decisions every time you capture something adds a lot of friction to the process.** This makes the experience mentally taxing and thus less likely to happen in the first place.

>This is why it’s so important to **separate capture and organize into two distinct steps:** “keeping what resonates” in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term.

>Most notes apps have an **“inbox”** or **“daily notes”** section where new notes you’ve captured are saved until you can revisit them and decide where they belong. Think of it as a waiting area where new ideas live until you are ready to digest them into your Second Brain. Separating the capturing and organizing of ideas helps you **stay present**, **notice what resonates**, and **leave the decision of what to do with them to a separate time** (such as a “weekly review,” which I will cover in Chapter 9).


>[!quote]
> The four main categories are **ordered by actionability** to make the decision of where to put notes as easy as possible:
> - Projects are most actionable because you’re working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind.
> - Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable.
> - Resources may become actionable depending on the situation.
> - Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.

>[!quote]
> This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note, starting at the **top of the list and moving down**:
> 1. In which project will this be most useful?
> 2. If none: In which area will this be most useful?
> 3. If none: Which resource does this belong to?
> 4. If none: Place in archives.

>In other words, you are always trying to place a note or file not only where it will be useful, but where it will be **useful the soonest**. 

>Personal projects and long-term goals feel especially flexible, like you can always get around to them later. Notes, bookmarks, highlights, and research that we worked hard to find sink deeper and deeper into our file systems, until eventually we forget they even exist.

>Organizing by actionability counteracts our tendency to constantly procrastinate and postpone our aspirations to some far-off future. 

### Organizing Information Like a Kitchen—What Am I Making?


> Instead of organizing ideas according to where they come from, I recommend organizing them according to where they are going—specifically, the outcomes that they can help you realize. The true test of whether a piece of knowledge is valuable is not whether it is perfectly organized and neatly labeled, but whether it can have an impact on someone or something that matters to you.
> 
> PARA isn’t a filing system; it’s a production system. It’s no use trying to find the “perfect place” where a note or file belongs. There isn’t one. The whole system is constantly shifting and changing in sync with your constantly changing life.

>When it comes to our personal knowledge, there is no such assigned spot. We are organizing for actionability, and “what’s actionable” is always changing.

>Any piece of information (whether a text document, an image, a note, or an entire folder) can and should Мow between categories. 

>The purpose of a single note or group of notes can and does change over time as your needs and goals change. Every life moves through seasons, and your digital notes should move along with them, churning and surfacing new tidbits of insight from the deep waters of your experience.

### Completed Projects Are the Oxygen of Your Second Brain

>Your efforts to capture content for future use will be tremendously easier and more effective if you **know what that content is for**. Using PARA is not just about creating a bunch of folders to put things in. It is about **identifying the structure of your work and life**—what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go.

>The first is that people need clear workspaces to be able to create. We cannot do our best thinking and our best work when all the “stuff” from the past is crowding and cluttering our space. That’s why that **archiving step is so crucial**: you’re not losing anything, and it can all be found via search, but you need to **move it all out of sight and out of mind.**

>Second, I learned that **creating new things is what really matters**. I’d see a fire light up in people’s eyes when they reached the finish line and published that slideshow or exported that video or printed that résumé. The newfound confidence they had in themselves was unmistakable as they walked out of the store knowing they had everything they needed to move forward.

>I’ve learned that **completed creative projects are the blood flow of your Second Brain.** They keep the whole system nourished, fresh, and primed for action. **It doesn’t matter** how organized, aesthetically pleasing, or impressive your notetaking system is. It is only the steady completion of tangible wins that can infuse you with a sense of determination, momentum, and accomplishment. It doesn’t matter how small the victories. Even the tiniest breakthrough can become a stepping-stone to more creative, more interesting futures than you can imagine.

### Your Turn: Move Quickly, Touch Lightly

>[!quote]
>A mentor of mine once gave me a piece of advice that has served me ever since: **move quickly and touch lightly.**
>
>To look for the path of least resistance and make progress in short steps. I want to give the same advice to you: **don’t make organizing your Second Brain into yet another heavy obligation**. Ask yourself: “What is the smallest, easiest step I can take that moves me in the right direction?”

> Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you think of the projects that might be on your plate:
> - Notice what’s on your mind: What’s worrying you that you haven’t taken the time to identify as a project? What needs to happen that you’re not making consistent progress on?
> - Look at your calendar: What do you need to follow up on from the past? What needs planning and preparation for the future?
> - Look at your to-do list: What actions are you already taking that are actually part of a bigger project you’ve not yet identified? What communication or follow-up actions you’ve scheduled with people are actually part of a bigger project?
> - Look at your computer desktop, downloads folder, documents folder, bookmarks, emails, or open browser tabs: What are you keeping around because it is part of a larger project?

>You could also create folders for your areas and resources, but I recommend starting only with projects to **avoid creating lots of empty containers.** You can always add others later when you have something to put inside them. 

>Practice capturing new notes, organizing them into folders, and moving them from one folder to another. Each time you finish a project, move its folder wholesale to the archives, and each time you start a new project, look through your archives to see if any past project might have assets you can reuse.

>As you create these folders and move notes into them, don’t worry about reorganizing or “cleaning up” any existing notes. You can’t afford to spend a lot of time on old content that you’re not sure you’re ever going to need. Start with a clean slate by putting your existing notes in the archives for safekeeping. If you ever need them, they’ll show up in searches and remain just as you left them.

>Your goal is to clear your virtual workspace and gather all the items related to each active project in one place. Once you do, you’ll gain the confidence and clarity to take action on those ideas, rather than letting them pile up with no end in sight.

>The key thing to keep in mind is that these categories are anything but final. **PARA is a dynamic, constantly changing system, not a static one.** Your Second Brain evolves as constantly as your projects and goals change, which means you never have to worry about getting it perfect, or having it finished.
