# PART THREE - The Shift: Making Things Happen

## Chapter 9: The Essential Habits of Digital Organizers

>[!quote]
>Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks… It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.
 — James Clear, author of *Atomic Habits*

>Your Second Brain is a practical system for enhancing your **productivity** and your **creativity**

>While these domains are often seen as mutually exclusive opposites—one **concrete and defined**; the other **abstract and open-ended**—instead I see them as **complementary**. When we are organized and efficient, that creates space for creativity to arise. When we have confidence in our creative process, we don’t have to think about it as much, significantly reducing the background stress of constantly worrying whether we’re going in the right direction.

>This balance between order and creativity is something that we can build into our Second Brain intentionally. Like every system, a Second Brain needs **regular maintenance**. 

>Being organized is a **habit**—a repeated set of actions you take as you encounter, work with, and put information to use. ... At each step of CODE, there are habits that can help us be more organized so that our creativity has space to arise.

### The Mise-en-Place Way to Sustainable Productivity

>**This fundamental tension—between quality and quantity—is a tension we share as knowledge workers.** We also must produce work to an extremely high standard, and we must do it fast, continuously, all year long. 

>**mise en place** is a step-by-step process for producing high-quality food efficiently. ... They learn to keep their workspace **clean and organized in the flow** of the meals they are preparing.

>this means small habits...

>Chefs use mise en place—a philosophy and mindset embodied in a set of practical techniques—as their “external brain.”1 It gives them a way to **externalize their thinking into their environment** and **automate the repetitive parts** of cooking so they can **focus completely on the creative parts.**

>We have a lot to learn as knowledge workers from the system of mise en place. ... We also receive a constant stream of inputs and requests, have too little time to process them, and face many demands requiring simultaneous attention. For us as well, the only time we have available to **maintain** our systems is **during the execution of our regular work**.

>We tend to notice our systems need maintenance **only when they break down**, which we then blame on our lack of self-discipline or our failure to be sufficiently productive.

>[!quote]
>Building a Second Brain is not just about downloading a new piece of software to get organized at one point in time; it is about **adopting a dynamic, flexible system** and **set of habits** to **continually** access what we need **without throwing our environment (and mind) into chaos**.


>In this chapter, I will introduce you to three kinds of habits that can be integrated into your routine to ensure your Second Brain remains functional and relevant.
>
>- **Project Checklists**: Ensure you start and finish your projects in a consistent way, making use of past work.
>- **Weekly and Monthly Reviews**: Periodically review your work and life and decide if you want to change anything.
>- **Noticing Habits**: Notice small opportunities to edit, highlight, or move notes to make them more discoverable for your future self.
>  
>You can think of these habits as the **“maintenance schedule”** of your Second Brain. 


### The Project Checklist Habit: The Key to Starting Your Knowledge Flywheel

>At the most basic level, knowledge work is about taking in information and then turning it into results.

>What most people are missing, however, is a feedback loop—a way to **“recycle” the knowledge** that was created as part of **past efforts** so it can be used **in future** ones as well. 

>This is exactly how I want you to treat your attention—as an asset that gets invested and produces a return, which in turn can be reinvested back into other ventures. This is how you can ensure your knowledge **grows and compounds over time** like a high-yield asset. 

>If you look closely, there are two key moments in this process of recycling knowledge. Two places where the paths diverge, and you have the chance to do something different than you’ve done before.
#### Checklist #1: Project Kickoff

>The way most people launch projects, in contrast, can be described as “haphazardly.” ... The successful start of the project is more or less left to chance.

> If we consider that these projects are our biggest investments of attention, it’s worth adding a little bit of structure to how we start them. This is where the Project Kickoff Checklist comes in.
> 
> Here’s my own checklist:
> 1. **Capture** my current thinking on the project.
> 2. **Review** folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes.
> 3. **Search** for related terms across all folders.
> 4. **Move** (or **tag**) relevant notes to the project folder.
> 5. **Create an outline** of collected notes and **plan** the project

> 1. Capture my current thinking on the project. ... Here are some **questions** I use to prompt this initial brainstorm:
> 	- What do I **already know** about this project?
> 	- What don’t I know that I **need to find out**?
> 	- What is my **goal** or intention?
> 	- **Who** can I talk to who might provide insights?
> 	- What can I **read or listen to** for relevant ideas?

> 2. Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes. Second, I look through any existing folders that might contain information relevant to the new project I’m starting, including related templates, outlines, and outtakes from previous projects. ... PARA and Progressive Summarization really come in handy here: I already have a variety of folders, each containing a curated set of notes, highlighted and summarized so I can **rapidly recall** what they’re about. ... Then I quickly scan any notes inside that look **interesting**, taking care to **keep the momentum** going so I don’t get bogged down anywhere.

> 3. Search for related terms across all folders. The third step is to perform searches for any notes I might have missed. ... because each and every note in my Second Brain was **deliberately chosen**, I am able to search through a collection of exclusively **high-quality notes** free of fluff and filler.
>    
>    I run a series of searches for terms related to the new project, scanning the results and quickly jumping into any note that seems relevant. Progressive Summarization helps here too, enabling me to **zoom into and out** of notes without having to absorb their full contents.

> 4. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder. Fourth, any notes found in the previous two steps I move to the project folder, titled after the name of the new project I’m starting. 

> 5. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project. Finally, it’s time to pull together the material I’ve gathered and create an outline (an Archipelago of Ideas) for the project. My goal is to end up not just with a loose collection of ideas. It is to **formulate a logical progression of steps** that make it clear what I **should do next**.
>    
>    The form this outline takes depends on the nature of the project. 
>    
>    The important thing to remember as you move through this checklist is that you are making a plan for **how to tackle the project**, **not executing the project itself**. You should think of this five-step checklist as a first pass, taking no more than twenty to thirty minutes.You’re only trying to get a sense of what kind of material you already have in your Second Brain. Once you do, you’ll have a much better sense of **how much time it will take**, which **knowledge or resources** you’ll need access to, and what your **challenges** will likely be.

> Here are some other options for actions you might want to include in your own version:
> - **Answer premortem questions**: What do you want to learn? What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question you want to answer? What is most likely to fail?
> - **Communicate with stakeholders**:
> - **Define success criteria**: What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful? What are the minimum results you need to achieve, or the “stretch goals” you’re striving for?
> - **Have an official kickoff**: 

#### Checklist #2: Project Completion

>The completion of a project is a very special time in a knowledge worker’s life because it’s one of the **rare moments when something actually ends**. Part of what makes modern work so challenging is that nothing ever seems to finish. ... This is one of the best reasons to **keep our projects small**: so that we get to feel a fulfilling **sense of completion as often as possible.** 

>We want to learn from the experience and document any thinking that could add value in the future. This is where the Project Completion Checklist is essential. ... The only way that the Kickoff Checklist we just looked at will be feasible is **if you’ve previously taken the time to save and preserve material from past projects.**

> Here’s my checklist:
> 1. **Mark** project as **complete** in task manager or project management app.
> 2. **Cross out** the associated project goal and **move to “Completed” section**.
> 3. **Review** Intermediate Packets and **move** them to other folders.
> 4. **Move** project to **archives** across all platforms.
> 5. If project is becoming inactive: **add a current status note** to the project folder **before archiving**.

>1. Mark project as complete in task manager or project management app. This is the first step is making sure the project is in fact finished. 

> 2. Cross out the associated project goal and move to “Completed” section. Each project I work on usually has a corresponding goal. I keep all my goals in a single digital note, sorted from short-term goals for the next year to long-term goals for years to come. 
>    
>    I like to take a moment and **reflect** on whether the **goal** I initially set for this project **panned out**. If I successfully achieved it, what factors led to that success? How can I repeat or double down on those strengths? If I fell short, what happened? What can I learn or change to avoid making the same mistakes next time?
>    
>    I also like to cross out the goal and move it to a different section called “Completed.”

> 3. Review Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders. Third, I’ll look through the folder for the completed project to identify any Intermediate Packets I created that could be repurposed in the future. 
>    
>    It takes a certain lens to see each of these documents and files not as disposable, but as tangible by-products of quality thinking. Much of our work gets repeated over time with slight variations. If you can start your thinking where you left oА last time, you’ll be far ahead compared to starting from zero every time.

> 4. Move project to archives across all platforms. Fourth, it’s time to move the project folder to the archives in my notes app, as well as any other platforms I used during the project. 

> 5. If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project folder before archiving. The fifth step applies only if the project is getting canceled, postponed, or put on hold instead of completed. I still want to archive it so it’s out of sight, but in this special case, there’s one final action I take.
>    
>    I add a new note to the project folder titled “Current status,” and jot down a few comments so I can pick it back up in the future. ...  This Hemingway Bridge gives me the confidence to put the project on ice knowing I can bring it back to life anytime.


> Here are some other items you can include on your Project Completion
> - **Checklist**. I encourage you to personalize it for your own needs: Answer postmortem questions: What did you learn? What did you do well? What could you have done better? What can you improve for next time?
> - **Communicate with stakeholders**: Notify your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., that the project is complete and what the outcomes were.
> - **Evaluate success criteria**: Were the objectives of the project achieved? Why or why not? What was the return on investment?
> - **Officially close out the project and celebrate**: Send any last emails, invoices, receipts, feedback forms, or documents, and celebrate your accomplishments with your team or collaborators so you receive the feeling of fulfillment for all the effort you put in.

>Since you don’t know for sure that any of this material will ever be useful again, you should minimize how much extra time and attention you invest in it. Put in just enough effort that your future self will be able to decide if the material is relevant to their needs. If it is, then they can decide in that moment whether to invest the effort to further organize and distill it.

>The purpose of using project checklists isn’t to make the way you work rigid and formulaic.
### The Review Habit: Why You Should Batch Process Your Notes (and How Often)

>The practice of conducting a “Weekly Review” was pioneered by executive coach and author David Allen in his influential book Getting Things Done. ... Allen recommends using a Weekly Review to write down any new to-dos, review your active projects, and decide on priorities for the upcoming week.
>
>I suggest adding one more step: review the notes you’ve created over the past week, give them succinct titles that tell you what’s inside, and sort them into the appropriate PARA folders.

#### A Weekly Review Template: Reset to Avoid Overwhelm

>Here is my own Weekly Review Checklist, which I usually complete every three to seven days depending on how busy a given week is. ...
>
> 1. Clear my email inbox.
> 2. Check my calendar.
> 3. Clear my computer desktop.
> 4. Clear my notes inbox.
> 5. Choose my tasks for the week.


#### A Monthly Review Template: Reflect for Clarity and Control

>I recommend doing a Monthly Review that is a bit more reflective and holistic. It’s a chance to evaluate the big picture and consider more fundamental changes to your goals, priorities, and systems that you might not have the chance to think about in the busyness of the day-to-day.
>
>Here’s mine:
> 1. Review and update my goals.
> 2. Review and update my project list.
> 3. Review my areas of responsibility.
> 4. Review someday/maybe tasks.
> 5. Reprioritize tasks.

### The Noticing Habits: Using Your Second Brain to Engineer Luck

>I call them “noticing” habits—taking advantage of **small opportunities** you notice to capture something you might **otherwise skip over** or to **make a note** more **actionable or discoverable**.

> - Noticing that an idea you have in mind could potentially be valuable and capturing it instead of thinking, “Oh, it’s nothing.”
> - Noticing when an idea you’re reading about resonates with you and taking those extra few seconds to highlight it.
> - Noticing that a note could use a better title—and changing it so it’s easier for your future self to find it.
> - Noticing you could move or link a note to another project or area where it will be more useful.
> - Noticing opportunities to combine two or more Intermediate Packets into a new, larger work so you don’t have to start it from scratch.
> - Noticing a chance to merge similar content from different notes into the same note so it’s not spread around too many places.
> - Noticing when an IP that you already have could help someone else solve a problem, and sharing it with them, even if it’s not perfect.

>It’s crucial to stay organized, but it needs to be done **a little at a time** in the **flow of our normal lives**. It needs to be done in the **in-between moments** of moving your projects forward as you notice small opportunities for improvement.

>All these actions take mere moments, and are made in response to **changes in your priorities and goals.** We should **avoid doing a lot of heavy lifting up front**, not only because it takes up precious time and energy, but because it locks us into a course of action that might not end up being right.



### Your Turn: A Perfect System You Don’t Use Isn’t Perfect

> Each of the three kinds of habits I’ve introduced you to—**Project Kickoff and Completion Checklists**, **Weekly and Monthly Reviews**, and **Noticing Habits**— are all meant to be performed quickly in the in-between spaces of your day.
> 
> They are designed to build on activities you are probably already doing in some form, adding perhaps a little bit more **structure**. 


> I want to remind you that the **maintenance** of your Second Brain is very **forgiving**. ...
> 
> To make this concrete:
> - There’s no need to capture every idea; the best ones will always come back around eventually.
> - There’s no need to clear your inbox frequently; unlike your to-do list, there’s no negative consequence if you miss a given note. 
> - There’s no need to review or summarize notes on a strict timeline; we’re not trying to memorize their contents or keep them top of mind.
> - When organizing notes or files within PARA, it’s a very forgiving decision of where to put something, since search is so effective as a backup option.

>The truth is, any system that must be perfect to be reliable is deeply flawed. A perfect system you don’t use because it’s too complicated and error prone isn’t a perfect system—it’s a fragile system that will fall apart as soon as you turn your attention elsewhere.

>We have to remember that we are not building an encyclopedia of immaculately organized knowledge. We are building a **working system**.
