# PART THREE - The Shift: Making Things Happen

## Chapter 10: The Path of Self-Expression

>[!quote]
>our **challenge** isn’t to acquire more information; as we saw in the exploration of divergence and convergence, it is to **find ways to close off the stream** so we can **get something done**. Any change in how we interact with information first requires a change in how we think.


### Mindset Over Toolset—The Quest for the Perfect App

>[!quote]
> it is never a person’s toolset that constrains their potential, it’s their **mindset**.

>There is no divide between our inner selves and our digital lives: the beliefs and attitudes that shape our thinking in one context inevitably show up in other contexts as well.

>Underlying our struggles and challenges with productivity, creativity, and performance is our **fundamental relationship to the information in our lives**. ... You adopted a default “blueprint” for how you treated incoming information— with anticipation, fear, excitement, self-doubt, or some complex mix of feelings that is unique to you.

>Our attitude toward information profoundly shapes how we see and understand the world and our place in it. Our success in the workforce depends on our ability to make use of information more **effectively** and to think better, smarter, faster. 


### The Fear Our Minds Can’t Do Enough

>When it comes to accomplishing our goals, it’s not that innate intelligence isn’t valuable. I’m saying that the greater the burden you place on your biological brain to give you everything you want and need, the more it will struggle under the weight of it all. You’ll feel more stressed, anxious, like there are way too many balls in the air.

>It is this fundamental attitude toward information that will start to change as you integrate your Second Brain into your life. You will begin to see **connections** you didn’t know you could make. ... You will naturally start to combine these ideas to form new perspectives, new theories, and new strategies. 

>Once you start seeing even your biggest ambitions in terms of the **smaller chunks of information** they are made up of, you’ll begin to realize that any experience or passing insight can be **valuable**. Your fears, doubts, mistakes, missteps, failures, and self-criticism— it’s all just information to be taken in, processed, and made sense of. All of it is part of a larger, ever-evolving whole.

>As you build a Second Brain, your biological brain will inevitably change. It will start to adapt to the presence of this new technological appendage, treating it as an extension of itself. Your mind will become **calmer**, knowing that every idea is being **tracked**. It will become more **focused**, knowing it can put thoughts on hold and access them later. 



### Giving Your First Brain a New Job

>it’s time to fire your biological brain from that job and give it a new one: as the CEO of your life, orchestrating and managing the process of turning information into results. We’re asking your biological brain to hand over the job of **remembering to an external system**, and by doing so, freeing it to absorb and integrate new knowledge in more creative ways.

>Your Second Brain is always on, has perfect memory, and can scale to any size. The more you outsource and delegate the jobs of capturing, organizing, and distilling to technology, the more time and energy you’ll have available for the self-expression that only you can do.

>... you’ll be **free to expand** the flow of information as much as you want without drowning in it. You’ll be more **balanced and peaceful** ... You will be more **trusting** ... You will be more **open-minded** .... You’ll want to expose yourself to more diverse perspectives, from more people, without necessarily committing to any single one. You’ll become a curator of perspectives, free to pick and choose the beliefs and concepts that serve you best in any given situation.

>That is why building a Second Brain is a journey of **personal growth**. As your information environment changes, the way your mind operates starts to be transformed. You leave behind one identity and step into another—an identity as the orchestrator and conductor of your life, not its passenger. 

### The Shift from Scarcity to Abundance

>I see so many people trying to operate in this new world under the assumptions of the past—that information is **scarce**, and therefore we need to **acquire and consume and hoard** as much of it as possible. ... Through the lens of scarcity, we constantly **crave** more, more, more information, a response to the fear of not having enough.

>As we saw in the chapter on Capturing, the inclination to amass information can **become an end in itself**. It is all too easy to default to collecting more and more content without regard to whether it is useful or beneficial to us. ... It is driven by fear—the fear of missing out on some crucial fact, idea, or story that everyone is talking about. The **paradox of hoarding** is that **no matter how much we collect and accumulate, it’s never enough.** The **lens of scarcity** also tells us that the information we already have must **not be very valuable**, compelling us to keep searching externally for what’s missing inside.

>The opposite of a **Scarcity Mindset** is an **Abundance Mindset**. This is a way of looking at the world as **full of valuable and helpful things**—ideas, insights, tools, collaborations, opportunities. An Abundance Mindset tells us that there is an endless amount of incredibly powerful knowledge everywhere we look ... It also tells us that **we don’t need to consume or understand all of it**, or even much of it. **All we need is a few seeds of wisdom**, and the seeds we most need tend to **continually find us again and again**. 

>Making the shift to a mindset of abundance ... It means giving up low-value work that gives us a false sense of security but that doesn’t call forth our highest selves. It’s about **letting go of low-value information that seems important, but that doesn’t make us better people.** It’s about putting down the protective shield of fear that tells us we need to protect ourselves from the opinions of others, because that same shield is keeping us from receiving the gifts they want to give us.

### The Shift from Obligation to Service

>There is a second shift that occurs when you begin to use your Second Brain not only for **remembering**, but for **connecting and creating**. You will transition from doing things primarily **out of obligation** or **pressure** to doing things from a spirit of **service**.

>I believe most people have a natural desire within them to serve others. They want to teach, to mentor, to help, to contribute. The desire to give back is a fundamental part of what makes us human.

>I also notice that many people put that desire on hold. They are waiting for a future time when they will have “enough” time, bandwidth, expertise, or resources.

>**You are under no obligation to help others**. Sometimes it’s all you can do to take care of yourself. ... Faced with the evidence of everything they already know, suddenly there’s **no longer any reason to wait.**

>[!quote]
>The purpose of knowledge is to be shared. 

>Learning shouldn’t be about hoarding stockpiles of knowledge like gold coins. Knowledge is the only resource that gets better and more valuable the more it multiplies. ... Knowledge becomes more powerful as it spreads.

>There are problems in the world that you are uniquely equipped to solve.

>There are people who will be reached only if they are reached by you. ... With mere words, you can open doors to unimaginable horizons for the people around you.

### The Shift from Consuming to Creating

>[!quote]
>The practice of building a Second Brain is more than the sum of capturing facts, theories, and the opinions of others. At its core, it is about **cultivating self-awareness and self-knowledge**. When you encounter an idea that **resonates** with you, it is because that idea **reflects back to you** something that is already within you. **Every external idea is like a mirror**, surfacing within us the truths and the stories that want to be told.

>we can easily perform as humans that we can’t fully explain. .. We can try to describe how we do these things, but our explanations always fall far short. That’s because we are relying on **tacit knowledge**, which is impossible to describe in exact detail. We possess that knowledge, but it resides in our subconscious and muscle memory where language cannot reach.

>This problem—known as **“self-ignorance”**—has been a major roadblock in the development of artificial intelligence and other computer systems. Because we cannot describe how we know what we know, it can’t be programmed into software.

>As you build your Second Brain, you will collect many facts and figures, but they are just a **means to an end**: **discovering the tacit knowledge** that lives within you. It’s in there, but you need external hooks to pull it out and into your conscious awareness. If we know more than we can say, then we need a system for continuously offloading the vast wealth of knowledge we’ve gained from real life experience.

>[!quote]
>The **process of knowing yourself** can seem mystical, but I see it as eminently practical. It starts with **noticing what resonates with you**. Noticing what seems to call out to you in the external world and gives you a sense of déjà vu. There is a universe of thoughts and ideas and emotions within you. Over time, you can uncover new layers of yourself and new facets of your identity. **You search outside yourself to search within yourself**, knowing that **everything you find has always been a part of you**.


### Our Fundamental Need for Self-Expression

>I discovered something through that experience: that **self-expression is a fundamental human need**. **Self-expression** is as vital to our survival as food or shelter. We must be able to share the stories of our lives—from the small moments of what happened today at school to our grandest theories of what life is about.


### Your Turn: The Courage to Share

> The world is desperate to hear what you know. You can change lives by sharing yourself with others.
> 
> It takes courage and vulnerability to stand up and deliver your message. It takes going against the grain, refusing to be quiet and hidden in the face of fear. Finding your voice and speaking your truth is a radical act of self-worth
> 
> The only way to discover the answer to these questions is by speaking and seeing what comes out. 


### Final Thoughts: You Can Do This

>There is no single right way to build a Second Brain. Your system can look like chaos to others, but if it brings you progress and delight, then it’s the right one.


>As your needs change, give yourself the freedom to discard or take on whichever parts serve you. 


>If at any point you feel overwhelmed, take a step back and focus on what is immediately necessary: your most important projects and priorities. Scale back to only the notes you need to move those priorities forward. Instead of trying to architect your entire Second Brain system from scratch up front, focus on moving one project at a time through each step from capturing to expressing. When you do so, you’ll find that the steps are much easier and more flexible than you imagined.



>While building a Second Brain is a project—something you can commit to and achieve within a reasonable period of time—using your Second Brain is a lifelong practice. I recommend you revisit Building a Second Brain at various points over time. I guarantee you’ll notice things you missed the first time.
