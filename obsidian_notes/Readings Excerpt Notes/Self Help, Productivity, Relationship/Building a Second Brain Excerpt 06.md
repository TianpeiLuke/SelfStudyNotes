# PART TWO - The Method: The Four Steps of CODE

## Chapter 7: Express—Show Your Work

### How to Protect Your Most Precious Resource

>[!quote]
>As knowledge workers, **attention is our most scarce and precious resource.**

>The creative process is fueled by attention at every step. It is the lens that allows us to make sense of what’s happening, to notice what resources we have at our disposal, and to see the contribution we can make. The ability to intentionally and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. We have to jealously guard it like a valuable treasure.

>Attention can be cultivated but also destroyed— by distractions, interruptions, and environments that don’t protect it. The challenge we face in building a Second Brain is how to establish a system for personal knowledge that frees up attention, instead of taking more of it.

>We’ve been taught that it’s important to work **“with the end in mind.”** We are told that it is our responsibility to **deliver results**, whether that is a finished product on store shelves, a speech delivered at an event, or a published technical document.

>This is generally good advice, but there is a flaw in focusing only on the final results: **all the intermediate work—the notes, the drafts, the outlines, the feedback—tends to be underappreciated and undervalued.** The precious attention we invested in producing that in-between work gets thrown away, never to be used again. Because we manage most of our “work-in-process” in our head, as soon as we finish the project and step away from our desks, all that valuable knowledge we worked so hard to acquire dissolves from our memory like a sandcastle washed away by the ocean waves.

>The final stage of the creative process, **Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know.** It is about expressing your ideas **earlier**, more **frequently**, and in **smaller chunks to test** what works and **gather feedback** from others. That feedback in turn **gets drawn in to your Second Brain**, where it becomes the starting point for the next iteration of your work.

### Intermediate Packets: The Power of Thinking Small

>The idea of **dividing our work into smaller units** isn’t new. You’ve probably heard this advice a hundred times: if you’re stuck on a task, break it down into smaller steps.

> Every profession and creative medium has its own version of “intermediate steps” on the way to full-fledged final works. For example:
> - “Modules” in software development
> - “Betas” tested by start-ups
> - “Sketches” in architecture
> - “Pilots” for television series
> - “Prototypes” made by engineers
> - “Concept cars” in auto design
> - “Demos” in music recording

>Here’s what most people miss: it’s not enough to simply divide tasks into smaller pieces—you then **need a system for managing those pieces.** Otherwise, you’re just creating a lot of extra work for yourself trying to keep track of them.
>
>**That system is your Second Brain**, and the small pieces of work-in-process it contains I call “Intermediate Packets.” **Intermediate Packets** are the concrete, individual building blocks that make up your work. ... Any note can potentially be used as an Intermediate Packet in some larger project or goal.

>Like LEGO blocks, the more pieces you have, the easier it is to build something interesting. 

>Our time and attention are scarce, and it’s time we treated the things we invest in—reports, deliverables, plans, pieces of writing, graphics, slides—as knowledge assets that can be reused instead of reproducing them from scratch. **Reusing Intermediate Packets** of work frees up our attention for higher-order, more creative thinking. **Thinking small is the best way to elevate your horizons and expand your ambitions.**

>There are five kinds of Intermediate Packets you can create and reuse in your work:
> - **Distilled notes**: Books or articles you’ve read and distilled so it’s easy to get the gist of what they contain (using the Progressive Summarization technique you learned in the previous chapter, for example).
> - **Outtakes**: The material or ideas that didn’t make it into a past project but could be used in future ones.
> - **Work-in-process**: The documents, graphics, agendas, or plans you produced during past projects.
> - **Final deliverables**: Concrete pieces of work you’ve delivered as part of past projects, which could become components of something new.
> - **Documents created by others**: Knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work

>You should always cite your sources and give credit where credit is due. 

> Making the shift to working in terms of Intermediate Packets unlocks several very powerful **benefits**.
> 
> First, you’ll become **interruption-proof** because you are focusing only on one small packet at a time, instead of trying to load up the entire project into your mind at once. You become less vulnerable to interruptions, because you’re not trying to manage all the work-in-process in your head.
> 
> Second, you’ll be able to **make progress in any span of time.** **Instead of waiting until you have multiple uninterrupted hours**—which, let’s face it, is rare and getting rarer—you can look at how many minutes you have free and choose to work on an IP that you can get done within that time, even if it’s tiny. Big projects and goals become less intimidating because you can just **keep breaking them down into smaller and smaller pieces**, until they fit right into the gaps in your day
> 
> Third, Intermediate Packets increase the **quality** of your work by allowing you to **collect feedback more often.** Instead of laboring for weeks in isolation, only to present your results to your boss or client and find out you went in the wrong direction, you craft just one small building block at a time and get outside input before moving forward. You’ll find that people give much better feedback if they’re included early, and the work is clearly in progress.
> 
> Fourth, and best of all, eventually you’ll have so many IPs at your disposal that you can execute entire projects just by **assembling previously created IPs.** This is a magical experience that will completely change how you view **productivity.** The idea of **starting anything from scratch** will become foreign to
> you ... all you’re doing is drawing on a **growing library of Intermediate Packets** stored in your Second Brain. If they are truly valuable assets, then they deserve to be managed, just like any other asset you possess.

>Intermediate Packets are really a new lens through which you can perceive **the atomic units** that make up everything you do.

### Assembling Building Blocks: The Secret to Frictionless Output

>While you can sit down to purposefully create an IP, it is far more powerful to simply notice the IPs that you have already produced and then to take an extra moment to save them in your Second Brain.

>Our creativity thrives on examples. When we have a template to fill in, our ideas are channeled into useful forms instead of splattered around haphazardly. There are best practices and plentiful models for almost anything you might want to make.

>Your Second Brain is the repository of things **you are already creating and using anyway.** All we are doing is adding a little bit of structure and intentionality to how we use them: **capturing them in one place**, such as a digital notes app, so we can find them with a search; **organizing them according to our projects, areas, and resources**, so we have a dedicated place for each important aspect of our lives; and **distilling them down to their most essential points,** so they can be quickly accessed and retrieved.

>You might be able to scramble and put together a particular document right when you need it, but there will be a slowly accumulating, invisible cost. The cost of not being quite sure whether you have what you need. The stress of wondering whether you’ve already completed a task before. 

### How to Resurface and Reuse Your Past Work

>The Express step is where we practice and hone our ability to retrieve what we need, when we need it. It’s the step where we build the confidence that our Second Brain is working for us.

>These are some of the most valuable connections—when an idea **crosses the boundaries between subjects.** They can’t be planned or predicted. They can emerge only when many kinds of ideas in different shapes and sizes are **mixed together.**

>This inherent unpredictability means that **there is no single, perfectly reliable retrieval system** for the ideas contained in your notes. Instead, there are four methods for retrieval that overlap and complement one another. Together they are more powerful than any computer yet more flexible than any human mind.
>
>You can step through them in order until you find what you’re looking for. Those four retrieval methods are:
> 1. Search
> 2. Browsing
> 3. Tags
> 4. Serendipity

#### Retrieval Method #1: Search

>Search has the benefit of costing almost nothing in terms of time and effort. Just by saving your notes in a central place, you enable software to search their full contents in seconds. You can run multiple searches in quick succession, running down rabbit trails through your knowledge garden as you try out different variations of terms.

>In a sense, every note in your Second Brain is already “open,” and you can view or interact with its contents with a mere click or tap.

>**Search should be the first retrieval method you turn to.** It is most useful when you already know more or less what you’re looking for... it has its **limitations.** If you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for, don’t have a preexisting folder to look through, or are interested in images or graphics, it’s time to turn to browsing.

#### Retrieval Method #2: Browsing

>If you’ve followed the PARA system outlined in Chapter 5 to organize your notes, you already have a series of **dedicated folders** for each of your active projects, areas of responsibility, resources, and archives.
>
>... When the time comes to **take action**, you’ll be able to enter the appropriate workspace and know that everything found there is relevant to the task at hand.

>As powerful as search can be, studies have found that in many situations people strongly prefer to navigate their file systems manually, scanning for the information they’re looking for. ... Browsing allows us to gradually home in on the information we are looking for, starting with the general and getting more and more specific. 

>Once again, there are limitations to what you can find by browsing folders. Sometimes you know a project is coming and can start saving things to a project folder **in advance**, but sometimes you don’t. Sometimes it’s very clear which area of your business a note is related to, but **often you have no idea where to put it**. Many notes end up being useful in completely **unexpected ways.** We want to encourage that kind of **serendipity**, not fight it!

#### Retrieval Method #3: Tags

>Tags are like small labels you can apply to certain notes regardless of where they are located. Once they are tagged, you can perform a search and see all those notes together in one place. 

>The main **weakness of folders** is that ideas can get siloed from each other, making it hard to spark interesting connections. Tags can overcome this limitation by infusing your Second Brain with **connections**, making it easier to see cross-disciplinary themes and patterns that defy simple categorization.

>I don’t recommend using tags as your primary organizational system. **It takes far too much energy to apply tags to every single note** compared to the ease of searching with keywords or browsing your folders. However, tags can come in handy in specific situations when the two previous retrieval methods aren’t up to the task, and you want to spontaneously **gather, connect, and synthesize** groups of notes **on the fly**.

#### Retrieval Method #4: Serendipity

>The fourth retrieval method is the most mysterious but, in many ways, the most powerful. Beyond searching, browsing, and tagging, there is a frontier of possibility that simply cannot be planned or predicted by human minds. There are moments when it feels like the stars **align and a connection between ideas jumps out at you** like a bolt of lightning from a blue sky. These are the moments **creatives** live for.

>There is no way to plan for them, but that doesn’t mean we can’t create the ideal conditions for them to arise. 

>**Serendipity** takes a few different forms when it comes to retrieval.
>
>First, while using the previous retrieval methods, it is a good idea to **keep your focus a little broad.** Don’t begin and end your search with only the specific folder that matches your criteria. Make sure to look through **related categories,** such as similar projects, relevant areas, and different kinds of resources.
>
>Second, serendipity is amplified by visual patterns. This is why I strongly suggest saving not only text notes but images as well (which is difficult to do in other kinds of software such as word processors). 
>
>Third, **sharing our ideas with others** introduces a major element of serendipity. When you present an idea to another person, **their reaction is inherently unpredictable.** They will often be completely uninterested in an aspect you think is utterly fascinating; they aren’t necessarily right or wrong, but you can use that feedback either way. The reverse can also happen. You might think something is obvious, while they find it mind-blowing. That is also useful feedback. Others might point out aspects of an idea you never considered, suggest looking at sources you never knew existed, or contribute their own ideas to make it better. All these forms of feedback are ways of drawing on not only your first and Second Brains, but the brains of others as well.


### Three Stages of Expressing: What Does It Look Like to Show Our Work?

#### Remember: Retrieve an Idea Exactly When It’s Needed

>You don’t need to invent a new theory or write the next great novel to derive value from your Second Brain. Within days of capturing ideas that resonate with you, you’ll start to **notice opportunities** to share them with others **to their benefit**.

#### Connect: Use Notes to Tell a Bigger Story

>Creative expression isn’t always about self-promotion or advancing our own career. Some of our most beautiful, creative acts are ones in which we **connect the dots for others** in ways they wouldn’t be able to do themselves.

#### Create: Complete Projects and Accomplish Goals Stress-Free

>Whatever you are responsible for creating—whether it is documents or presentations or decisions or outcomes—your Second Brain is a **vital repository of all the bits and pieces** you’ll want in front of you when you sit down to **focus**. It is a **creative environment** you can step into at any time, in any place, when it’s time to make things happen.

### Creativity Is Inherently Collaborative

>It doesn’t matter what medium you work in; sooner or later you must work with others. 

>Reframing your work in terms of **Intermediate Packets** isn’t just about doing the same old stuff in smaller chunks. That doesn’t unlock your true potential. The **transformation** comes from the fact that **smaller chunks are inherently more shareable and collaborative.**

>**It is much easier to show someone a small thing, and ask for their thoughts on it**, rather than the entire opus you’re creating. It’s less confronting to hear criticism on one small aspect of your work, **at an early stage** when you still have time to correct it, than getting a negative reaction after months of effort. You can **use each little piece of intermediate feedback to refine what you’re making**—to make it more focused, more appealing, more succinct, or easier to understand.

>[!quote]
>The fundamental difficulty of creative work is that we are often **too close to it** to see it **objectively**. Getting feedback is really about borrowing someone else’s eyes to see what only a novice can see. It’s about **stepping outside your subjective point of view** and noticing **what’s missing** from what you’ve made.

>Once you understand how incredibly valuable feedback is, you start to crave as much of it as you can find. 

>These moments are so important that you will begin changing how you work in order to get feedback as early and often as possible, because you know it is much easier to gather and synthesize the thoughts of others than to come up with an endless series of brilliant thoughts on your own. 

>There are certain notes in your Second Brain that are **disproportionately valuable**, that you will find yourself **returning to again and again.** These are the **cornerstones** of your work on which everything else is built, but you can’t usually know which notes are cornerstones up front. You discover them by sharing your ideas with others, and seeing which ones resonate with them. It is by sharing our ideas with other people that we discover which ones represent our most valuable expertise.

### Everything Is a Remix

>[!quote]
>The CODE Method is based on an important aspect of creativity: that **it is always a remix of existing parts.** **We all stand on the shoulders of our predecessors. No one creates anything out of a pure void.**

>Don’t take the work of others **wholesale**; **borrow aspects or parts** of their work. ... Of course, cite all your sources and influences, even if you don’t strictly have to. Giving credit where credit is due doesn’t lessen the value of your contribution—it increases it. Having a Second  Brain where all your sources are clearly documented will make it much easier to **track them down** and include those citations in the finished version.

>[!quote]
>**Reframing your productivity in terms of Intermediate Packets** is a major step toward this turning point. Instead of thinking of your job in terms of **tasks**, which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of **assets and building blocks** that you can assemble.

### Your Turn: You Only Know What You Make

> [!quote]
> To truly “know” something, it’s not enough to read about it in a book. **Ideas are merely thoughts until you put them into action.** Thoughts are fleeting, quickly fading as time passes. To truly make an idea stick, you have to engage with it. You have to get your hands dirty and **apply that knowledge to a practical problem.** We **learn by making concrete things**—before we feel ready, before we have it completely figured out, and before we know where it’s going.

>It is when you begin **expressing your ideas** and **turning your knowledge into action** that life really begins to **change**. You’ll read differently, becoming more **focused** on the parts most **relevant** to the argument you’re building. You’ll ask **sharper questions**, no longer satisfied with vague explanations or leaps in logic. You’ll naturally **seek venues to show your work**, since the feedback you receive will propel your thinking forward like nothing else. You’ll begin to **act more deliberately** in your career or business, thinking several steps beyond what you’re consuming to consider its ultimate potential.

>it’s about **taking ownership of your work**, your ideas, and your potential to contribute in whatever arena you find yourself in. It doesn’t matter how impressive or grand your output is, or how many people see it....  You have to **value your ideas enough to share them.** 

>All of these are acts of self-expression enabling you to begin unlocking your full creative potential.
