## Book Excerpt

> The human brain is a prediction machine. ... Whenever you experience something repeatedly ... your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.

> With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. ... your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the _foundation for every habit_ you have.

>This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful.

> Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible. ... we must begin the process of behavior change with **awareness**.

> One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the _Habits Scorecard_

> * To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.
>   
> * Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.

> The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals.

> The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. 
> 
> Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real.

>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness.
