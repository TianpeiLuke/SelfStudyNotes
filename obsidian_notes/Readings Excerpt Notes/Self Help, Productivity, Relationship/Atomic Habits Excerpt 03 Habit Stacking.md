## Book Excerpt

>[!quote]
> No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.
>
> When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called **habit stacking**.

>[!quote]
> The habit stacking formula is: 
> “After \[CURRENT HABIT\], I will \[NEW HABIT\].”

> The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together.
