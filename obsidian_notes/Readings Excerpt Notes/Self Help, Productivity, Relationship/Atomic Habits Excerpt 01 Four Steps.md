## Book Excerpt


>The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
>
> * First, there is the __cue__. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. 
>   
> * __Cravings__ are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire — without craving a change — we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. 
>   
> * The third step is the __response__. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. 
>   
>  * Finally, the response delivers a **reward**. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.
>    
>    ** The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. 
>    ** Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.
