## Book Excerpt

> Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again **under certain environmental conditions**.

> The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are to try it. ... The truth, however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.

> The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. ... Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.

> If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, _make the cue a big part of your environment_. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues. 

> The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.

> Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it.

\- HOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS

> The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the **entire context** surrounding the behavior.

> Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the **environment** but by _our relationship to them_. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. 

> The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a _new environment_. It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. 

> It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.

> When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one.

> Whenever possible, **avoid mixing the context** of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits — and _the easier ones_ will usually win out.

>If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. _Habits thrive under predictable circumstances_ like these.
