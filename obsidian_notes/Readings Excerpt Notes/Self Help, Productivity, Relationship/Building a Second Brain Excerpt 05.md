# PART TWO - The Method: The Four Steps of CODE

## Chapter 6: Distill—Find the Essence

### Quantum Notetaking: How to Create Notes for an Unknown Future

>Our notes are things to use, not just things to collect.

>When you first capture them, your notes are like unfinished pieces of raw material. They require a bit more **refinement** to turn them into truly valuable knowledge assets, like a chemist distilling only the purest compound. This is why we separate capturing and organizing from the subsequent steps: you need to be able to store something quickly and save any future refinement for later.

>In this sense, notetaking is like time travel—you are sending packets of knowledge through time to your future self.

>There is a key idea that catches our attention in the moment. We feel enraptured and obsessed with it. It’s difficult to imagine ever forgetting the new idea. ... But after a few hours or days or weeks, it starts to fade from our memory. Soon our recollection of that exciting new idea is nothing but a pale shadow of something we once knew, that once intrigued us. Your job as a notetaker is to **preserve the notes** you’re taking on the things you discover in such a way that **they can survive the journey into the future**. 

### Discoverability—The Missing Link in Making Notes Useful

>The most important factor in whether your notes can survive that journey into the future is their **discoverability—how easy it is to discover what they contain and access the specific points that are most immediately useful.**

>[!quote]
>**Discoverability** is an idea from information science that refers to “the degree to which a piece of content or information can be found in a search of a file, database, or other information system.”

>Discoverability is the element most often missing from people’s notes. It’s easy to save tons and tons of content, but turning it into a form that will be accessible in the future is another matter. To enhance the discoverability of your notes, we can turn to a simple habit you probably remember from school: highlighting the most important points. **Highlighting** is an activity that everyone understands, takes hardly any additional effort, and works in any app you might use.

>Imagine your future self as a demanding customer. They will surely be **impatient and very busy**. They won’t have time to pore through page after page of details just to find the hidden gems. 

>Your future self might have mere minutes before a meeting starts to quickly search their notes for a reference they need. In that sense, each note is like a product you are creating for the benefit of that future customer. If they don’t buy it—they don’t think it’s worth the effort of revisiting past notes—then all the value of the work you’re doing now will be lost.

>the more notes they gather, the more the volume of information grows, **the more time and effort it takes to review it all**, and **the less time they have to do so.** ... they miss out on most of the benefits of **their knowledge compounding over time.**

>What do you do when communicating with a very busy, very impatient, very important person? You **distill your message down to the key points and action steps.**

>[!quote]
>**Distillation is at the very heart of all effective communication.** The more important it is that your audience hear and take action on your message, the more distilled that message needs to be. The details and subtleties can come later once you have your audience’s attention.

### Highlighting 2.0: The Progressive Summarization Technique

>**Progressive Summarization** takes advantage of a tool and a habit that we are all intimately familiar with—highlighting—while leveraging the unique capabilities of technology to make those highlights far more useful than anything you did in school.

>[!quote]
>The technique is simple: you **highlight the main points of a note**, and then **highlight the main points of those highlights**, and so on, **distilling the essence of a note in several “layers.”** **Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart.**

>This is what I call “layer one”—the chunks of text initially captured in my notes. Notice that I didn’t save the entire article—only a few **key excerpts.**
>
>... As interesting as this content is, it’s not nearly succinct enough. 

>To enhance the discoverability of this note, I need to add a second layer of distillation. I usually do this when I have free time during breaks or on evenings or weekends, when I come across the note while working on other projects, or when I don’t have the energy for more focused work. All I have to do is bold the main points within the note. This could include **keywords that provide hints** of what this text is about, **phrases that capture what the original author was trying to say**, or **sentences that especially resonated with me** even if I can’t explain why.

>For those notes that are especially long, interesting, or valuable, it is sometimes worth adding a third layer of highlighting. I advise using the “highlighting” feature offered by most notes apps, which paints passages in bright yellow just like the fluorescent highlighters we used in school (which appear in light gray below). ... Look **only at the bolded passages** you identified in **layer two** and **highlight only the most interesting and surprising of those points.** This will often amount to just one or two sentences that encapsulate the message of the original source.

>There is one more layer we can add, though it is quite rarely needed. For only the very few sources that are truly unique and valuable, I’ll add an **“executive summary”** at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words.

>I recommend using bullet points to encourage yourself to make this executive summary succinct. Use your own words, define any unusual terms you’re using, and think about how your future self, who may not remember anything about this source, might interpret what you’re writing.


### Zooming In and Out of Your Map of Knowledge

>The layers of Progressive Summarization give you multiple ways of interacting with your notes depending on the needs of the moment. The first time you read about a new idea, you might want to **dive into the details** and explore every nuance. The next time you **revisit that idea**, you probably don’t want to repeat all that effort and read the same piece from beginning to end again. You want to pick up where you left off, looking only at the **highlights left over** from the last time you visited that note. You can review all the details at layer one, or if you’re pressed for time (and when are we ever not pressed for time?), just focus on layers two, three, or four. You can **customize how much attention** you spend on a note based on your energy level and time available.

>It’s like having a digital map of your notes that can be zoomed in or out depending on how many details you want to see ...sometimes you want to **zoom in** and examine one specific research finding, while other times you want to **zoom out** and see the broad sweep of an argument all at once.

>With Progressive Summarization, you are building up a map of the best ideas found in your Second Brain. Your highlights are like signposts and waypoints that help you navigate through the network of ideas you’re exploring. You are building this map without moving anything or deleting anything. Every sentence gets left right where you found it, giving you the freedom to leave things out without worrying that you’ll lose them. With this map in hand, you can actually see what you’ve captured, helping you find what you’re looking for but also what you don’t even know you’re looking for.

>The multiple layers of Progressive Summarization are like a **safety net**; if you go in the wrong direction, or make a mistake, you can always just go back to the original version and try again. **Nothing gets forgotten or deleted.**

>Progressive Summarization helps you **focus on the content and the presentation** of your notes, instead of spending too much time on labeling, tagging, linking, or other advanced features offered by many information management tools. It gives you a practical, easy thing to do that **adds value** even when you don’t have the energy for more challenging tasks. Most importantly, it keeps your **attention on the substance of what you’re reading or learning**, which is what matters in the long term.

### Four Examples of Progressive Summarization

#### Wikipedia Articles

>By saving the best excerpts from Wikipedia articles you read, you can create your own private encyclopedia with only the parts that are most relevant to you.

#### Online Articles

>Much of the time we consume information without a specific purpose in mind.

>These moments are some of the most valuable opportunities to capture tidbits of insight that you probably might not find otherwise. Because this casual reading and listening tends to range over a wide number of topics and interests, you are exposed to more diverse ideas than usual.

#### Podcasts and Audio

>Notes can come in handy even when you’re not able to write them down in real time. 

#### Meeting Notes

>Taking notes during meetings is a common practice, but it’s often not clear what we should do with those notes. 

### Picasso’s Secret: Prune the Good to Surface the Great

> Starting with the top left image and moving across and down, Picasso deconstructed the shapes of the bull one step at a time. In the first couple of drawings, he **adds more detail**. ... Picasso is starting by
> building up detail so that he has **more options to choose from** when it comes time to **take some away**.
> 
> The process of distillation begins with the fourth image. .. In the fifth and sixth images, the drawing starts to become **radically simplified** as Picasso drops most of the detail in the bull’s head and further simplifies its horns, tail, and legs.
> 
> ... We end with a drawing that is nothing but a single, continuous stroke, which somehow still manages to capture the very essence of the bull

>Picasso’s act of distillation involves **stripping away the unnecessary** so that only the essential remains. Crucially, Picasso couldn’t have started with the single line drawing. He needed to go through each layer of the bull’s form step-by-step to absorb the proportions and shapes into his muscle memory. The result points to a mysterious aspect of the creative process: it can end up with a result that looks so simple, it seems like anyone could have made it. That simplicity masks the effort that was needed to get there.


>[!quote]
>Progressive Summarization is not a method for remembering as much as possible—it is a method for **forgetting as much as possible.** As you distill your ideas, they naturally improve, because when you drop the merely good parts, the great parts can shine more brightly. 

>To be clear, it takes skill and courage to let the details fall away.


### The Three Most Common Mistakes of Novice Notetakers

#### Mistake #1: Over-Highlighting

>The biggest mistake people make when they start to distill their notes is that they highlight way too much.

>When it comes to notetaking for work, less is more. ... you’ll quickly learn that such volume will only create a lot more work later on when you have to figure out what all that information means. **If you’re going to capture everything, you might as well capture nothing.**

>Remember that notes are not authoritative texts. **You don’t need to and shouldn’t include every tiny detail.** They are more like bookmarks peeking out from the pages of a book on the shelf ... You will always be able to go back and review the full, original source if needed. Your notes only solve the problem of rediscovering those sources when you need them.

>A helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include **no more than 10–20 percent of the previous layer.** 

#### Mistake #2: Highlighting Without a Purpose in Mind

>The most common question I hear about Progressive Summarization is “When should I be doing this highlighting?” The answer is that you should do it **when you’re getting ready to create something.**

>Unlike Capture and Organize, which take mere seconds, **it takes time and effort to distill your notes.** If you try to do it with every note up front, you’ll quickly be mired in hours of meticulous highlighting with no clear purpose in mind. You can’t afford such a giant investment of time without knowing whether it will pay off.
>
>Instead, wait until you know how you’ll put the note to use. 

>You have to always assume that, **until proven otherwise, any given note won’t necessarily ever be useful.** You have no idea what your future self will need, want, or be working on. This assumption forces you to be **conservative in the time you spend summarizing notes**, **doing so only when it’s virtually guaranteed that it will be worth it.**

>The rule of thumb to follow is that **every time you “touch” a note**, you should **make it a little more discoverable for your future self** —by adding a highlight, a heading, some bullets, or commentary. This is the “campsite rule” applied to information—**leave it better than you found it.** This ensures that the notes you interact with most often will naturally become the most discoverable in a virtuous cycle.

#### Mistake #3: Making Highlighting Difficult

>**Don’t worry about analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing each point to decide whether to highlight it.** That is way too taxing and will break the flow of your concentration. Instead, rely on your intuition to tell you when a passage is interesting, counterintuitive, or relevant to your favorite problems or a current project.

>Just as you listened for a feeling of **internal resonance** in deciding what content to save in the first place, the same rule applies for the insights within the note. Certain passages will move you, pique your attention, make your heart beat faster, or provoke you. Those are clear signals that you’ve found something important, and it’s time to add a highlight. 

### Your Turn: Keep Your Future Self in Mind

>[!quote]
>The effort we put into Progressive Summarization is meant for one purpose: **to make it easy to find and work with our notes in the future.**

>More is not better when it comes to thinking and creating. Distilling makes our ideas small and compact, so we can load them up into our minds **with minimal effort.** If you can’t locate a piece of information quickly, in a format that’s convenient and ready to be put to use, then you might as well not have it at all. **Our most scarce resource is time**, which means we need to **prioritize our ability to quickly rediscover the ideas** that we already have in our Second Brain.

>When the opportunity arrives to do our best work, it’s not the time to start reading books and doing research. **You need that research to already be done.** You can prepare in advance for the future challenges and opportunities you don’t even yet know you’ll face, by **taking advantage of the effort you’re already spending reading books, learning new things, and simply being curious about the world around you.**

>The true test of whether a note you’ve created is discoverable is **whether you can get the gist of it at a glance.** **Put it aside for a few days and set a reminder to revisit it once you’ve forgotten most of the details.** When you come back to it, give yourself **no more than thirty seconds** and see if you can rapidly get up to speed on what it’s about using the highlights you previously made. You’ll quickly be able to tell if you’ve added too many highlights or too few.

>Each time you decide to add a highlight, you are developing your judgment: **distinguishing the bits that truly matter from those that don’t.** ... you know that every minute of attention you invest is creating lasting value. There are few things more satisfying than the feeling of making consistent progress.
