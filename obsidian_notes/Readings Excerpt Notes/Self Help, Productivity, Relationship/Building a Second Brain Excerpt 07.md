# PART THREE - The Shift: Making Things Happen
## Chapter 8: The Art of Creative Execution

>All the steps of the CODE Method are designed to do one thing: **to help you put your digital tools** to work for you so that your human, fallible, endlessly creative first brain can do what it does best. **Imagine. Invent. Innovate. Create.**

>Building a Second Brain is really about **standardizing** the way we work, because we only really improve when we standardize the way we do something. To get stronger, you need to lift weights using the correct form. 

> Through the simple acts of capturing ideas, organizing them into groups, distilling the best parts, and assembling them together to create value for others, we are practicing the basic moves of knowledge work in such a way that we can improve on them over time.
> 
> This **standardized routine** is known as **the creative process**, and it operates according to timeless principles that can be found throughout history. By identifying the principles that stand the test of time despite huge changes in the underlying technology, we can better understand the essential nature of creativity

>The **products** of creativity are constantly changing and there is always a new “hot” trend to run after. ...
>
>But if you go one level deeper, to the **process** of creativity, it is a very different story. 

>One of the most important patterns that underlies the creative process is called **“divergence and convergence.”**

### Divergence and Convergence: A Creative Balancing Act

![[diverg_converg_creative.png]]

>A creative endeavor **begins with an act of divergence**. You open the space of possibilities and consider as many options as possible. ... you begin to gather different kinds of outside inspiration, expose yourself to new influences, explore new paths, and talk to others about what you’re thinking. The number of things you are looking at and considering is increasing—you are diverging from your starting point.

>the purpose of divergence is to **generate new ideas**, so the process is necessarily **spontaneous, chaotic, and messy**. You **can’t fully plan or organize** what you’re doing in divergence mode, and you shouldn’t try. This is the time to wander.

>As powerful and necessary as divergence is, if all we ever do is diverge, then we never arrive anywhere. ...  at some point you must **start discarding possibilities and converging toward a solution.** Otherwise, you will never get the rewarding sense of completion that comes with hitting “send” or “publish” and stepping back from the canvas or screen knowing you got the job done.

>**Convergence forces us to eliminate options**, **make trade-offs**, and **decide what is truly essential.** It is about **narrowing the range of possibilities** so that you can make forward progress and end up with a final result you are proud of. Convergence allows our work to take on a life of its own and become something separate from ourselves.

>The model of divergence and convergence is so fundamental to all creative work, we can see it present in any creative field.

>If we overlay **the four steps of CODE** onto the model of **divergence and convergence**, we arrive at a powerful template for the creative process in our time.

![[diverg_converg_code.png]]

>The first two steps of CODE, **Capture and Organize, make up divergence.** They are about gathering seeds of imagination carried on the wind and storing them in a secure place. This is where you research, explore, and add ideas. The final two steps, **Distill and Express, are about convergence.** They help us shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge building blocks we’ve assembled.

### The Three Strategies I Use to Bring Creative Work Together

>When you **distinguish** between the **two modes of divergence and convergence**, you can decide each time you begin to work which mode you want to be in, which gives you the answers to the questions above. In **divergence mode**, you want to open up your horizons and explore every possible option. Open the windows and doors, click every link, jump from one source to another, and let your curiosity be your guide for what to do next. If you decide to enter **convergence mode**, do the opposite: close the door, put on noise-canceling headphones, ignore every new input, and ferociously chase the sweet reward of completion. **Trust that you have enough ideas and enough sources**, and it’s time to turn inward and sprint toward your goal.

>Of the two stages of this process, **convergence is where most people struggle.**

>The more imaginative and curious you are, the more diverse your interests, and the higher your standards and commitment to perfection, the more difficult you will likely find it to switch from divergence mode into convergence mode. It’s painful to **cut off options and choose one path** over another. There is a kind of creative grief in watching an idea that you know is full of potential get axed from a script or a story. This is what makes creative work challenging.

>When you sit down to finish something ... it can be **so tempting to do more research**. It’s so easy to open up dozens of browser tabs, order more books, or go off in completely new directions. Those actions are tempting because **they feel like productivity**. They feel like forward progress, when in fact they are **divergent acts that postpone the moment of completion.**

>There are three powerful strategies for completing creative projects I recommend to help you through the pitfalls of convergence. ... Think of them as the tools in your Second Brain tool belt, which you can turn to anytime you need to get unstuck, find your way around obstacles, or decide what to do next.

#### 1. The Archipelago of Ideas: Give Yourself Stepping-Stones

>The Archipelago of Ideas technique is valuable any time you are starting a new piece of work ... It gives you a way to plan your progress even when performing tasks that are inherently unpredictable. The technique is named after a quote by Steven Johnson

>An archipelago is a chain of islands in the ocean ... 

>To create an Archipelago of Ideas, you **divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that will form the backbone** of your essay, presentation, or deliverable. Once you have a **critical mass of ideas** to work with, you switch decisively into convergence mode and link them together in an order that makes sense.

>The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the age old practice of **outlining**—**laying out the points you want to include up front**, so that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together.

> Creating outlines digitally instead of on paper offers multiple major advantages:
> - A digital outline is far more **malleable and flexible**—you can add bullet points and cross them off, rearrange and expand on them, add bolding and highlights, and edit them after the fact as your thinking changes.
> - The outline can **link to more detailed content**—instead of trying to cram every last point onto the same page, you can link to both your own private notes and public resources on the web, which helps avoid overloading the outline with too much detail.
> - The outline is **interactive and multimedia**—you can add not only text, but images, GIFs, videos, attachments, diagrams, checkboxes, and more.
> - The outline is **searchable**—even if it gets long, you have a powerful search feature to instantly call up any term you’re looking for.
> - The outline can be **accessed and edited from anywhere**—unlike a piece of paper in a notebook, your outline is instantaneously **synced** to every one of your devices, and it can be viewed, edited, and added to from anywhere.


>An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most difficulty performing at the same time: **choosing ideas** (known as **selection**) and **arranging** them into a **logical flow** (known as **sequencing**).

>The **goal** of an archipelago is that instead of **sitting down to a blank page** or screen and stressing out about where to begin, you start with a series of small stepping-stones to guide your efforts. First you **select** the **points and ideas** you want to include in your outline, and then in a separate step, you **rearrange and sequence** them into an **order that flows logically**. This makes both of those steps far more efficient, less taxing, and less vulnerable to interruption.

>[!quote]
>Instead of starting with scarcity, **start with abundance—the abundance of interesting insights you’ve collected in your Second Brain.**


#### 2. The Hemingway Bridge: Use Yesterday’s Momentum Today

>Hemingway was known for a particular writing strategy, which I call the **“Hemingway Bridge.”** He would always **end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story.** Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would **stop when the next plot point became clear.** This meant that the **next time** he sat down to work on his story, he **knew exactly where to start.** He built himself a **bridge to the next day**, using **today’s energy and momentum to fuel tomorrow’s writing.**

>You can think of a Hemingway Bridge as a bridge between the islands in your Archipelago of Ideas. You may have the islands, but that is just the first step. The much more **challenging** work is **linking them together** into something that **makes sense**, whether it is a piece of writing, the design of an event, or a business pitch. The Hemingway Bridge is a way of **making each creative leap from one island to the next less dramatic and risky**: you keep some energy and imagination **in reserve** and use it as a **launchpad for the next step** in your progress.

> How do you create a Hemingway Bridge?  ...
> - **Write down ideas for next steps**: At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one.
> - **Write down the current status**: This could include your current biggest challenge, most important open question, or future roadblocks you expect.
> - **Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away**: Such as details about the characters in your story, the pitfalls of the event you’re planning, or the subtle considerations of the product you’re designing.
> - **Write out your intention for the next work session**: Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a certain milestone you want to reach.
> 
> The next time you resume this endeavor, ... you’ll have a rich set of **jumping-off points and next steps waiting for you**. 

>To take this strategy a step further, there is one more thing you can do as you wrap up the day’s work: send off your draft or beta or proposal for feedback. ... The next time you sit down to work on it again, you’ll have their input and suggestions to add to the mix of material you’re working with.


#### 3. Dial Down the Scope: Ship Something Small and Concrete

>“Scope” is a term from project management  ... The **scope** refers to **the full set of features** a software program might include.

>We also deliver complex pieces of work under strict deadlines. We also have limited time, money, attention, and support—there are always constraints we must work within.

>When the full complexity of a project starts to reveal itself, most people **choose to delay it**. This is true of projects at work, and even more true of side projects we take on in our spare time. We tell ourselves we just need more time, but **the delay ends up creating more problems than it solves.** We start to lose motivation as the time horizon stretches out longer and longer. Things get lost or go out of date. Collaborators move on, technology becomes obsolete and needs to be upgraded, and random life events never fail to interfere. Postponing our goals and desires to “later” often ends up depriving us of the very experiences we need to grow.

>The problem isn’t a lack of time. It is that we forget that **we have control over the scope of the project.** We can “dial it down” to a more manageable size, and we must if we ever want to see it finished

>There will always be something missing, or something else you think you need. Dialing Down the Scope recognizes that **not all the parts of a given project are equally important.** By dropping or reducing or postponing the least important parts, we can **unblock ourselves and move forward even when time is scarce.**

>Your Second Brain is a crucial part of this strategy, because **you need a place to save the parts that get postponed or removed.**

>That doesn’t mean you have to throw away those parts. One of the best uses for a Second Brain is to collect and save the scraps on the cutting-room floor in case they can be used elsewhere. ... You never know when the rejected scraps from one project might become the perfect missing piece in another. The possibilities are endless.

>Knowing that **nothing I write or create truly gets lost**—only saved for later use —gives me the confidence to aggressively cut my creative works down to size without fearing that I’ve wasted effort or that I’ll lose the results of my thinking forever. ... gives me the courage to share my ideas before they’re perfectly ready and before I have them all figured out. 

>Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time.

>This is the chicken-and-egg problem of creativity: **you don’t know what you should create, but you can’t discover what people want until you create something.** Dialing Down the Scope is a way of short-circuiting that paradox and testing the waters with something small and concrete, while still protecting the fragile and tentative edges of your work.

>**Divergence and convergence are not a linear path**, but a loop: once you complete one round of convergence, you can take what you’ve learned right back into **a new cycle** of divergence. Keep alternating back and forth, making iterations each time until it’s something you can consider “done” or “complete” and share more widely.

### Your Turn: Move Fast and Make Things

>Make an outline with your goals, intentions, questions, and considerations for the project. Start by writing out anything already on your mind, and then peruse your PARA categories for related notes and Intermediate Packets. These could include points or takeaways from previously created notes, inspiration from models or examples you want to borrow from, or templates you can use to follow best practices.

>Set a timer for a fixed period of time, such as fifteen or twenty minutes, and in one sitting see if you can complete a first pass on your project using only the notes you’ve gathered in front of you. No searching online, no browsing social media, and no opening multiple browser tabs that you swear you’re going to get to eventually. Only work with what you already have. This first pass could be a plan, an agenda, a proposal, a diagram, or some other format that turns your ideas into a tangible artifact.

>You are only creating the first iteration —a draft of your essay, a sketch of your app, a plan for your campaign. Ask yourself, “What is the smallest version of this I can produce to get useful feedback from others?”

>If you find that you can’t complete the first iteration in one sitting, start by building a Hemingway Bridge to the next time you can work on it. List open questions, remaining to-dos, new avenues to explore, or people to consult.

>If you feel resistance to continuing with this project later, try Dialing Down the Scope. 

>Throughout every step of this process, be sure to keep notes on anything you learn or discover, or any new Intermediate Packets you might want to seek out.
