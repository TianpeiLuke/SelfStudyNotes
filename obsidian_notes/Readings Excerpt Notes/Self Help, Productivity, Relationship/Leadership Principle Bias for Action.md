## Why is Bias for Action important?

>[!question]
> We're called to balance **Dive Deep** with **Bias For Action**. That means we'll move ahead, even when we don't have perfect information. Sometimes it pays off well, and sometimes it doesn't. But when it doesn't, we often learn more than we would have if we'd succeeded. 
> 
> We are in an extremely competitive business. We are growing and we cannot afford to become sluggish from size. Despite our long-term perspective, we must act swiftly…regularly. The art is in knowing when you have enough information to make a decision. All data gathering after that point is an unnecessary use of resources.
> 
> We balance **Insist on the Highest Standards**, **Dive Deep**, and **Bias for Action** by looking at the nature of the decision. If a decision is ***reversible***, we act quickly, because the cost of undoing the decision may be less than the cost of obtaining more perfect information. ***"Two-way doors" are reversible decisions*** i.e. if you've made a suboptimal two-way door decision, you do not have to live with the consequences for that long; you can reopen the door to go back through. Such decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgement individuals or small groups. On the other hand, if a decision is ***irreversible***, we will take the necessary time to Dive Deep and make sure we have as complete a picture as possible before implementing the decision. Irreversible (or nearly irreversible) decisions are also referred to as ***"One-way doors"***. These decisions must be made methodically, carefully, with great deliberation and consultation since you cannot get back to where you were before once the decision has been implemented.

> Bias for Action also shows up as initiative. It means being willing to pick up the phone or walk down the hall (or to another building) when you sent an email yesterday and haven’t heard back. It means finding another sticky to work on while you’re waiting for a code review. It means being the one to book the meeting and showing up on time. It means being prepared, and not expecting others to do the work for you. It means doing what it takes to make sure the job gets done, and gets done well.
>
> Bias for Action also means being impatient when there’s a customer problem – jumping onto a conference call before your pager goes off because you’ve been following the important metrics that let you know things aren’t right. It’s jumping into an investigation before somebody definitively knows it’s your issue, and, even when you know it’s not, but no one else is digging. It’s not waiting for approval before doing something you know is the right thing for the customer.

## To Do

>[!info]
> As individual contributor: 
>- Quickly identify if you need more info before taking action, request that info, and move forward?
>- Be ready, willing and able to roll up sleeves and assist with customer-facing tasks when needed?
>- Ask for help when needed in a timely manner?
>- Respond promptly to requests for information?
>- Follow up and deliver as promised?
>- Make sure you create an “action item list” (identify owner and target dates)?

- Bias For Action [Internal Wiki](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/LeadershipPrinciples/BiasForAction/)
  
- **Pros**: This LP is against the following cognitive bias
	- [[Information Bias]]
		- The tendency to *seek information* even when it *cannot affect action*.
	- [[Procrastination]]
	- [[Social Loafing]]
		- the phenomenon of a person *exerting less effort* to achieve a goal when they *work in a group* than when working alone.
- **Cons**: This LP would result in the following cognitive bias
	- [[Action Bias]]
		- The tendency for someone to *act* when faced with a problem even when *inaction would be more effective*, or to act when no evident problem exists.
	- [[Omission Bias]]
		- The tendency to *judge harmful actions* (commissions) as worse, or less moral, than equally *harmful inactions (omissions)*.
