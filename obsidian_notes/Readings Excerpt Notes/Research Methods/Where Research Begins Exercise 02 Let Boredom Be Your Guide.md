## Exercise: Let Boredom Be Your Guide

- The **goal**: To become *attentive to your **active dislikes***, identifying *questions that you "**should**" (in theory) be interested in based on your topic of interest, **but aren’t.*** 
  
  By **understanding what you don’t care about regarding your topic**, you accelerate the process of figuring out *what you do care about*.

- After all, the most common reaction human beings have to **boredom** is ***avoidance***. We try to dismiss or ignore things that bore us.

- But how would you explain ***why something bores you*** -- especially *something that seems like it should align with your topic of interest?* Here’s what to do:
	1. Go back to your search results, and **scan them again**.
	   
	2. Pay close attention to your EKG readout, focusing this time on the results that **bore** you. 
	   
	   In the very same way that we spoke of *not "outsmarting" yourself* regarding your interests, you will need to be cautious during this process as well. 
	   
	3. Choose a few "*boring*" results and **write down answers to the same questions you answered before** -- this time for these different, boring search results:
		- *What does this make me think of?*
		- *If I had to venture a guess, why did this one **not jump out at me?***
		- *What **questions** come to mind for me when I look at this search result?*
		  
	4. Now, for each search result, **write some version of this sentence:** 
	   
	   *"I’m **more interested in** \[something else\] **than** \[search result\]."*



**Common Mistakes**:

- **Denying boredom, or feigning interest** in something because you feel it’s *"on topic"* and demands your interest because it’s *"important."*
  
- Engaging in **circular logic**.
