## Exercise: Connect the Dots Using Your Sources

- The **goal**: To start thinking about ***source criticism*** early in the research process, while remaining **flexible and inclusive**.
  
- The steps for this exercise are straightforward:

	1. Identify all **my sources**. 
	   
	   Draw on what you wrote down for the *"Envision Your Primary Sources" exercise*. [[Where Research Begins Exercise 09 Envision Your Primary Sources]]
	   
	2. Determine *which primary sources **belong to my problem***. Be as honest as possible about *the problem that motivates you*. 
	   
	3. Determine which of the things I have are ***actually** (primary) sources*. [^1]
	   
	4. Find the best way to **form a narrative** by *arranging the primary sources.*  
	   
		- Trying out some narrative possibilities by **structuring and ordering** your sources in different ***configurations***, to see how they speak to one another. 
		  
		- The **key**, of course, is **not to force** any pieces of the puzzle **together**.
		  
	5. Determine **the number of *primary sources*** will I need to *answer my questions*, *solve my Problem*, and *complete my project*. [^2]


**Common Mistakes**:

- Thinking that *you have to have **all** your sources in hand **before you start** this process*. You will need to have **multiple** sources (dots) to begin this process, ***but not all***.
  
- Writing in pen rather than *pencil*. Recognize that the *connections* you make between sources right now are necessarily ***tentative and speculative***. 
  
  Expect that you will have to **reassess your judgments later on**, and *donâ€™t think that you have to "stick to" your original thought*.

- [^1] Read discussion on [[Determine My Primary Sources]]
- [^2] This is a question that only **you** can answer, although your *Sounding Board* might be able to help you make this assessment.
