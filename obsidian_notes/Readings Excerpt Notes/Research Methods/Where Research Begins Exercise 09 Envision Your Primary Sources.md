## Exercise: Envision Your Primary Sources

- The **goal**: To identify places you **might not have originally considered** looking for *primary sources.* 
  
- *This will enhance the **comprehensiveness**, **originality**, and **significance** of your research.*
  
- The steps for this exercise are straightforward:

	1. **Write down your research questions**, as always, with *as much precision as you can*.
	   
	2. **Brainstorm**:
	    *"What sources **might exist** that would be **primary with respect to my research questions?**"*
	   
	3. Write down *as many **types** of sources as possible*.
	   
	4. **Optional**: If you have time to spare, and as long as it doesnâ€™t distract you from steps 1 through 3, *try to **find such sources.*** 
	   
	   If you find any of them, put them through *the Cereal Box Challenge* [[Where Research Begins Exercise 08 Treat Your Primary Source Like a Cereal Box]]


**Common Mistakes**:

- During **brainstorming**, *thinking only in terms of your specific case* and not in terms of ***the general categories or institutional structures*** in which the world might have arranged sources related to your case
  
- ***Excluding*** sources because they do not *appear to be related to your **topic or keywords***.
  
- Worrying about *whether or not you can **actually** obtain the sources you envision.*
  
- Not writing things down.
