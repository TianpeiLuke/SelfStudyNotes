## Exercise: Go Small or Go Home

- The **goal**: To generate ***specific, fact-focused questions*** about your topic before you’ve done in-depth research. These will lead to bigger questions later on.

- You have a set of notes about two things:
	- *What you noticed about **sources on a topic**, and your **best guesses** as to **why you noticed** those things*

	- *What, among the "logical" or "obvious" aspects of your proposed topic, **bored you** and why*
    Using all of this as inspiration, try the following -- as always, in writing.
    
1. In a stream of consciousness, **write out a minimum of twenty questions related to your topic**. 
   
2. The **key** is to make your questions as ***specific*** as possible, using the following prompts:
	- *What facts do you **wish to know** about your topic?*
	  
	- *Which **data or information** about your topic might you need to satisfy your curiosity?*
	  
	- *What telling **details** about your topic do you **imagine might exist?***

- Asking **precise factual questions** is one *key* to *escaping Topic Land*.




**Common Mistakes**:

- Asking *vague, grand, abstract, or big-picture questions* about "meaning" or "significance,“ instead of **specific and precise factual questions**.
  
- Not asking actual questions (with a question mark), but instead writing statements or sentence fragments -- ***topics masquerading as questions***
  
- Not asking a question because **you think you couldn’t answer it**, perhaps because you think that the data doesn’t exist or is unattainable
  
- Asking *too few questions*, resulting in an inadequate quantity of self-evidence
