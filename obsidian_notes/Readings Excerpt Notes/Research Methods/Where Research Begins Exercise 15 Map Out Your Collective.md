## Exercise: Map Out Your Collective (Secondary Source Search)

- The **goal**: To use **one secondary source** from your *Problem Collective* to find **many more Problem Collective sources**.

- Follow these steps:
	1. Discover one piece of writing by *a member of your Collective*.
	   
	2. Read the ***table of contents***, the ***abstract***, the ***introduction***, the ***conclusion***.
	
	3. ***Skim*** the *body* of the text. 
	   
	4. Comb through the ***footnotes*** and the ***bibliography***.
	   
	5. Take note of *any **title** that jumps out at you*, no matter whether or not this work has any surface-level connection.
	   
	6. **Add** all of these *sources* to **your own research bibliography**.
	   
	7. Get your hands on ***every one of them*** you can, and go through the same process with *each of those new sources*.
	   
	8. Repeat this process until you feel *confident* that you have made **enough connections** to **begin some serious reading**, starting with *the most promising works*.
	   
	9. And as you read through these works *more closely*, and as you discover the ones that really do seem to be tapped into *the same problem as you*, **ask yourself** the following questions over and over:
		- *"What does this author **call my Problem**?"*
		  
		- *"What is this author’s **word** for the thing that **disturbs me**?"*
		  
		- *"What **vocabulary** does this author, who clearly seems to be kept awake at night by the same gnawing question as I am, use to **describe themselves**, whether professionally, intellectually, or otherwise?"*
		  
		  *Write down the answers* to these questions. Indeed, write down anything that comes to mind.

**Common Mistakes**:

- Not using the results of the *"Change One Variable"* exercise [[Where Research Begins Exercise 13 Change One Variable]] in this ***keyword search***.
  
- Dismissing your ***instinctual feeling of interest*** in or attraction to a ***secondary source*** because, *on the surface, it doesn’t appear to be directly related to your case*.

- Not writing down your answers to *the three questions* about **how the secondary sources you find describe or define your Problem**.
  
- *Giving up early, or not repeating the process* of analysis and introspection with **multiple secondary sources.**
  
- Only examining *secondary sources that are **in your Field***, meaning that you likely have *not significantly changed* your variables in the *"Change One Variable" exercise.*
