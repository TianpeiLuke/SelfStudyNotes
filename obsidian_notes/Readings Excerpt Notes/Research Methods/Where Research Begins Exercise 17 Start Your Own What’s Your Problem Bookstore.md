## Exercise: Start Your Own "What’s Your Problem?" Bookstore

- The **goal**: To **sort** studies in your **Field** by the ***problems*** that motivate instead of the *topic* they are “about," by **arranging** a small number of *secondary sources* into ***”problem sections."*** [^1]

- Follow these steps:
	1. Choose **six to eight short *secondary sources*** (articles or book chapters -- not entire books) in your **Field** related to your **topic**. [^1]
	   
	2. Using table 9 as a model, write down the **topic** of the first study in your list [^2]. Table 9 has following fields:
		- **Source Number**. 
		- **Study Title**. 
		- **Topic**. 
		- **Case.** 
		- **Problem.** 
		- **Problem Collective**. 
		  
	3. Now write down **the specific case** that the study *focuses on*. [^3]
	   
	4. List the **specific questions** that the study poses. [^4] Identify as many question as you can, striving to find **at least ten**.
	   
	5. Try to identify ***patterns** among those questions*. Analyze the list of the *tenplus questions* you’ve found, and ask yourself:
	   
		- *"If I had to venture a guess, **what does this author seem to be concerned about** or preoccupied with?"*
		  
		- *“What seems to be **driving** them?”*
		  
		  Pay attention as well to the questions that the **author doesn’t seem to be asking** -- questions which, for you, seem like *obvious ones*, but which *don't seem to be addressed in the study*.
		  
	6. Try to identify the **problem**. Try and see ***past the author's case study***, and *identify the **deeper-seated problem***.
	   
	   Write down a **one-sentence description of this problem** in as general terms as possible.
	   
	7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the other studies in your list.
	   
	8. Once you have completed this process for most or all of your studies, try to *identify any **themes** or **patterns** that **connect the different authors' Problems***. 
	   
	   If there are ones that seem to share something in common, try to **group them together**. Now try to give a ***name*** to these broader ***Problem Collectives*** (you may need to adjust your description, broadening or abstracting it a bit, which is OK). 


[^1] By this point in your research, you have compiled a **preliminary bibliography** of studies on your topic. Your *Sounding Board* has probably made some suggestions as well. 

*Don’t fret too much over the **selection of studies.*** As long as they are serious works of scholarship, and as long as they are *about* your topic, that’s all you need. You can always add more later.

[^2] Here is the place where you can *write **generalities***. This should be pretty straightforward. You should be able to *identify the topic even before reading the study*, using the introduction of the article or chapter (or even just the title).

[^3] Again, this should be pretty simple, since the case will likely be mentioned in the *title or the opening pages* of the study.

[^4] Here is where things get **more precise**, and where your **close reading skills** will pay off. Just as you did earlier with your own research -- where you **brainstormed and refined a host of small- and medium-scale questions** that together started to *add up* to a broader project -- here is where
you try to *identify the small- and medium-scale questions* that comprise the study you’re reading.


**Common Mistakes**:

- **Sorting** studies by ***topic or subtopic***, instead of ***by problem***.
  
- **Sorting** studies by ***case***, instead of by ***problem***.
