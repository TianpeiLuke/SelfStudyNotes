## Exercise: Rewrite for Your Field

- The **goal**: Informed by your Problem Collective, to learn to write about your Problem in a way that your **Field** will understand, and to see your Problem with *"Field eyes."*

- Follow these steps:
	1. Repeat the same process as *"Rewriting for Your Collective."* [[Where Research Begins Exercise 16 Find and Replace All Insider Language]] [^1]
	   
	2. Note that look over the **first draft of your proposal description** and **highlight** any terms that people ***in your Field*** are unlikely to know or be familiar with. These might include the following:
		- **Concepts and theories**. 
		- **Key authors relevant to the "Problem Collective" dimensions of your research**. 
		- **Key debates or arguments among members of your Collective**. 
		- **Personal names.** 
		- **Names of institutions or organizations.** 
		- **Titles**. 
		- **Acronyms**
		- **Periodization**
		- **Topics**
		  


[^1] When you rewrite for your **Field**, as opposed to your *Collective*, you will, alas, need to venture into what you consider to be *the less compelling features or logical associations with your core questions and problems.* This process would help you to **engage with other researchers** and consequently lead to new discovery and new problems.
