## Exercise: Create "Draft 0"

- The **goal**: To **consolidate** all of the different types of writing you have produced during ***the Self-Centered Research process*** thus far into a single document.

- Here is your checklist of items to compile: [^1]
	- Digital notes. 
	- Handwritten notes. 
	- **Underlinings, highlights, and marginalia.** Return to any *primary or secondary source* that you have marked up in one form or another. 
	  
- **Transcribe** these notes into your digital file. Be sure also to transcribe *full bibliographic information* as well, to *identify the **primary or secondary source*** you marked up.
  
- As you pull these items together in **Draft 0** [^2], also do the following:
	1. Tidy up (but only if it doesnâ€™t bog you down). 
	   
	2. Note down ***"self-evidence."*** One important exception to the **Do Not Revise Yet rule**: *during this transcription and consolidation process, **stay centered and "in tune" with yourself.***

- [^2] Pay attention to any **new thoughts or questions** that surface *while your consolidating your existing notes*, and ***write those thoughts down*** directly into the Draft 0 digital file (in Zettelkasten system).
