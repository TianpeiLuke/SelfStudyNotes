## Exercise: Before and After

- The **goal**: To identify *the **problem within a topic** that most interests you* by envisioning your research project within a ***larger problem-driven story***. To then *find other members of your Problem Collective* who are contributing to that story.

- Follow these steps:
	1. **Envision** your study as **a chapter** in a research **book focused on your Problem**.
	   
	2. **Write down a sentence describing your study**, as best you can summarize it.  Use this as a placeholder title for your *â€œcurrent chapter"* -- the project you are actually working on.
	
	3. Now imagine a ***logical progression** of a broader, book-length study delving into your Problem*:  
	   
	   *"What would be **the titles** of the chapters that **precede** and **follow yours**?"*
	   
	   Write down a chapter title for each of them. If you want to go further, think of what *additional chapters* of this hypothetical book might focus on.
	   
	4. Give that book a *compelling and descriptive title*.
	   
	5. Now come up with **at least two** (and ideally more) ***alternate scenarios***.
	   
	   Repeat the above steps, coming up with *titles for the current chapter, the preceding chapter, the next chapter, and the book*.
	   
	6. For each hypothetical book, **fill in a chart** like the one shown in table 8.[^1]
		- ***Book title:***
		- ***Preceding chapter:***
		- ***Current chapter:***
		- ***Next chapter:***
		- ***Excitement level: (low/medium/high)***
		- ***Why this response?***

**Common Mistakes**:

- **Talking yourself into *"liking"* a hypothetical project that your mentor suggests** or that seems to be the ***"obvious" choice*** because it is *related to the topic*.
  
  ***Avoid the power of suggestion**, and **trust your instincts.*** If you find yourself hesitating, take note of that.
  
- *Ignoring an **instinctual feeling of disinterest or boredom** in a hypothetical project*, or not taking the time to consider why you feel aversion to a potential project choice. **Dislikes can be instructive**.

- Based on this envisioning exercise, feeling like you need to *undertake a **major project** whose scope is **far beyond what you can realistically accomplish***.

Remember that the **goal** is to *pinpoint the problem that **excites** you* so that you can **find other members of your *Problem Collective****. Again: write, search, write!
  

[^1] Here, take as much space as you need to *assess, describe, and speculate* about *how and why* you responded the way you did to this envisioned scenario.

## Recommended Notes

- Writing down the table 8 in slip-box as a permanent note. Check on *How to Take Smart Note* to learn Zettelkasten method in [[How to Take Smart Note Book Summary]]

- [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 4]] also discuss how to identify the flow of ideas, and what is before and after us. It also suggests us to envision what is next.
