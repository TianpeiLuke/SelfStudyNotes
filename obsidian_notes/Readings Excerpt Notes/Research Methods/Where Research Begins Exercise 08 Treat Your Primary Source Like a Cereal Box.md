## Exercise: Identify the Problem That Connects Your Questions

- The **goal**: To adopt ***the habit of asking multiple genres of questions*** about each of your primary sources so as to *identify problems that are not self-evident* and thus might easily be *overlooked*. 
  
- This technique will both enable you to *decide which problem interests you most*, and *enhance your ability to conduct original research.*

	1. Using the search techniques you learned in [^1],  track down and obtain a single source. 
	   
	   It should be a source that you instinctively feel must be ***"primary" with regard to your emerging research concerns.***
	   
	2. Create a table (namely table 5 in the book) with 4 columns:
		1. ***What I notice** about the source*
		2. ***Questions/concerns** I might have*
		3. *The **very next** primary source I **might want to find***
		4. ***Broader** subjects and/or genres of questions that **might** be related to my problem*
	   
	3. Using table 5 as your guide, take notice of as many different ***features** of your source* as possible. 
		- ***Disaggregate** the source into its different **elements***. 
		- *Identify as many elements as possible, but no fewer than ten.*
		- You will need to ***abstract** and **extrapolate** from observations.* 
		- Fill in *column 1*. 
	   
	4. As you fill in the first column, try to imagine the kinds of **questions** that could be asked by *focusing on **one or another specific** feature of your source.* **Think expansively**. Add these questions to *column 2*.
	   
	5. Now imagine what a potential ***"very next source"*** might be for each of these feature- question pairings, and fill in *column 3*. [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 4]]
	   
	6. Finally, return to your increasingly skilled faculties of *introspection*, asking yourself:
		- *Which of these **feature-question-source** **lights my fire?***
		- *Which **excites** me the most? Why, if I had to venture a guess?*
		- *Which of these **bore** me? Why, if I had to venture a guess?*
		- *What does this suggest about what my **primary concerns** might be?*
		- *How is this source **"primary" with respect to my questions and concerns?***'
		
		Write them down.


**Common Mistakes**:

- Asking only *obvious or self-evident questions* related to the *ostensible topic of the source*, instead of **multiple genres of questions**.
  
- Asking questions that are vague and general instead of **specific and factual**.
  
- Asking *too few genres of questions* -- aim for at least ten. Err on the side of *being creative, even far-fetched.*
  
- For *"the very next primary source I might want to find,"*  thinking only of sources **within your Field.**
  
- After completing *the table of noticings, questions, next sources, and genres of questions*, skipping the steps of (a) **gauging your relative interest** in those results, and (b) **writing down** the result.
