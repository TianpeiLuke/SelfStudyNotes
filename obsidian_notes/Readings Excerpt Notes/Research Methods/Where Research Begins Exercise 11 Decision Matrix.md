## Exercise: Decision Matrix

- The **goal**: To envision which **factors** will likely have the greatest **impact**, *positive or negative*, on the success of your research project, and to adjust your plan accordingly.

- Consider the following **factors**:
	- ***Time***
	- ***Funding***
	- ***Writing speed***
	- ***Other responsibilities** 
	  (e.g. family, spouse, work etc.)*
	- ***Access** 
	  (e.g. data, equipment, library etc)*
	- ***Risk tolerance** 
	  (e.g. personal safety, career development etc)*
	- ***Abilities** 
	  (e.g. skills, knowledge, mental etc.)*
	- ***Human subjects** 
	  (e.g. social network etc.)*
	- ***Personality** 
	  (e.g. extrovert vs introvert etc.)*

- Following steps help us to fill in the **decision matrix**:
  
	1. Create an **inventory** of all of the factors that could ***impact the success*** of your project as you currently imagine it. Aim for a list of ten to fifteen factors.
	   
	2. **Categorize** each factor as *positive or negative*.
	   
	3. **Categorize** each factor as *high- , medium- , or low-impact*, depending on the degree to which you believe it will affect your project.
	   
	4. Write it down in a **table** and adjust your research questions accordingly.


**Common Mistakes**:

- **Underestimating** the **amount of time** it will take to complete the project.
  
- Listing only "*professional*" factors and failing to include **personal factors** that might have a real effect on your research progress.
  
- **Neglecting** to consider **ethical factors** such as the effects of human-subject research on participants
