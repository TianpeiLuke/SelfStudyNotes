## Exercise: Find and Replace All "Insider Language"

- The **goal**: To identify **language** in your writing that make sense **only to members of your Field** and to **rewrite** so that you can **connect** with members of your *Problem Collective*.

- Follow these steps:
	1. **Read** your *Field writing with ***Collective eyes***. 
	   
	   Print out a copy of your draft research proposal, and then **highlight** every instance of ***"insider language"*** you can find. Use different colors for different types of insider language.
	   
	2. **Rewrite your way out of your Field**. Now that you have annotated your document, *rewrite just those parts that youâ€™ve highlighted*. For each, do the following at first mention:
	   
		- **Individual**. Provide the full name, preferably with *a brief biographical description*.
		- **Institution**. Describe it in sufficient *detail*.
		- **Technical term**. Remove and replace with *a description of the phenomenon or principle.* If it is necessary to retain the term, define it.
		- **Adjectives and adverbs.** Find any words that are secretly trying to *"smuggle in" judgment statement* and *replace* them with language that is more ***specific**, **open-ended**, and **transparent***.
		- **Event.** Briefly explain what happened, and any relevant context.
		- **Acronym**. Remove and replace with the full name, or a brief description


**Common Mistakes**:

- Neglecting to **highlight** *obscure or Field-specific adjectives, adverbs, and verbs*, in addition to the *obvious nouns*.
  
- Using *only one highlighting color* (or font or notation style or other unique identifying mark-up technique), instead of **several**, which can help you more ***systematically and precisely identify your habits of using insider language.***

- Replacing *Field terms* with *different Field terms*, instead of with language ***comprehensible to a nonspecialist.***
