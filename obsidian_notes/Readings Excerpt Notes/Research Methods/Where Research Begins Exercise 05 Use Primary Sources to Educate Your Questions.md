## Exercise: Use Primary Sources to Educate Your Questions

- The **goal**: To learn *how to run **keyword searches** designed to **enhance or "educate" the questions** you are asking about your topic*. 
  
- These searches uncover ***primary sources*** relevant to your research that themselves contain **new keywords** you were previously unaware of (thereby enabling you to run follow-up searches to reveal even more, and more useful, primary sources).

- This next exercise requires you to delve back into your *specific subject matter* and into *primary sources*. Rather than trying to use primary sources to start answering the questions you’ve come up with, we want you to use them to **develop, refine, and expand those questions**.

- Here are some *techniques* to help you use primary sources to refine your keyword searches:
  
	- **Take Advantage of *Category Searches.*** In certain databases, you might be fortunate to come across materials that are accompanied by *metadata (data about data)*, crafted by librarians and archivists whose goal it is to make sources more discoverable to researchers like you. 
	   
	   This is one way to get from *a source that contains only the keywords you used* in your search to *another source that contains none of the keywords you used*. Here’s what to do: 
		1. After you run your search, and receive your results,  **sort the results chronologically**
		  
		2. As you scan through these **titles**, take notice: 
		  *What words show up in the title?* 
		  
		3. If you are able to read the work online, **scan the table of contents**, the **preface**, the **introduction**, and the **index**.  
		  *What words, terms, and vocabulary are used?*
		  These are your **new keywords**. *Write them down*.
		  
	- **Locate *Self-Reflexive Sources***. In some cases, you might be fortunate to find a primary source, like a historical dictionary, that *explicitly addresses the shifting nomenclature surrounding the very topic the primary source is about*, outlining for you the varied ways a given idea, place, community, practice, or the like has been named and renamed across time and space. 
	   
	   The goal for now is to determine if this source will *lead you **in the direction of further primary sources** that you wouldn’t have been able to find otherwise.*
	   
	- **Keep Track of Your Keywords and Searches**.  As you discover and try out more and more keywords -- and even a smaller-scale project can produce hundreds -- it’s easy to lose track of them and get overwhelmed. 
	   
	   Fortunately, there’s a simple solution: track your searches using a **table**. Here’s how, in three steps:
	   1. In the rows on the left side, **enter the keywords** you plan to use.
	   2. In the column headers, enter all of the *electronic **databases** or library **catalogues*** you plan to explore.
	   3. Inside each cell, keep track of **when** you ran a particular search. Enter *the **date** of your search*, and perhaps also a brief note on ***the number of results you found***.
