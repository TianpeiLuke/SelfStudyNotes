## Exercise: Use Primary Sources to Educate Your Questions

- The **goal**: To **become aware of the assumptions** you bring to your research project and use them to **identify the problem** that *motivates your research questions*.

- So let’s get to work on making your assumptions **visible**, and **vulnerable.** Here’s what to do:

	1. **Review** your most recent set of questions and ask yourself: 
	   
	   "*For each of these questions, what **has to be true in advance** in order for me to ask this question in the first place?*"
	   
	2. **List** the *small questions/things you noticed*, and **write down the assumptions** you may hold that helped you notice each in the first place.
	   
	3. **Make a list of the assumptions** you bring to ***this particular question***, and **sort** them into the following categories:
		- (A) *Assumptions you **want to work with**, for now*
		- (B) *Assumptions you want to **discard right away***
		- (C) *Assumptions you are **unsure or ambivalent about***
		  
	4. Write two lines to **justify your choice** for putting each assumption in a particular category.
	   
	5. Now go back to all of the questions in your list whose underlying assumptions fall into **Category (A)**. Since these are built on assumptions that you, having reflected on them, *feel safe in **maintaining***, then these questions are good as they are.
	   
	6. What about questions whose underlying assumptions fall into **Category (B)**? Although you might be tempted to, do not throw them away just yet! If you find them to be based on *weak, prejudicial, or unfounded assumptions*, try to **rephrase them** so that they aren’t. 
	   
	   *"Can they be **rebuilt** as more grounded, open-ended questions?"* Try to improve them **before you discard them**.
	   
	7. As for questions built on **Category (C)** assumptions, these fall somewhere in between. Most likely you *would want to keep them in your list*, but perhaps ***flag*** them, as reminders to yourself that you want to keep an eye on them, and **revisit them** as your research deepens.
	
- To keep things organized, try creating a **chart** like the one in table 3 for each question, in which you identify and analyze underlying assumptions and revise the question as needed.


**Common Mistakes**:

- **Not identifying or divulging the assumptions** motivating your research questions. -- for any reason, including embarrassment or self-consciousness. 
  
- **Not attempting** to **revise** or **restructure** a research question based on *Category (B) assumptions*.
  
- Dismissing or throwing out Category (C) assumptions}, instead of ***examining** them as a type of **self-evidence***.
