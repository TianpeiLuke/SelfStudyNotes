## Exercise: Find a New Problem and Start a New Project

- The **goal**: To begin *planning your research future* by thinking about **what other problems matter to you**, and **envisioning** how you might turn them into research projects.

- So, with all of this in mind, one thing you might do right now is to **identify a second problem** and **start a new project.**

- As we noted in the introduction, ***research is not a linear process.*** By that, we mean also that itâ€™s possible -- even desirable -- to **have multiple ideas and projects in play at a time.**


**Common Mistakes**:

- Thinking that research is a *linear* process, or that ***you have to finish Project 1 before you start Project 2***
  
- Mistaking **many areas of interest** as each being a ***separate problem.***
  
- Trying to take on **too many projects at one time.**
