## Exercise: Run a Diagnostic Test on Your Questions

- The **goal**: To ensure that the vocabulary, grammar, and phrasing of your questions are ***specific and unprejudiced*** so that they do not presume a certain outcome.

- Rewrite your research questions with particular attention to the following:

	- **Punctuation**. Do your questions actually end in a question mark? Or have you phrased them in more general, and vaguer term? **Be more specific, and add a question mark**.

	- **Adjectives and adverbs**. Do your questions rely on broad, generic, imprecise, or sweeping adjectives? **Try to cut such adjectives and adverbs out entirely**.

	- **Collective nouns.** Do your questions depend upon collective nouns? If so, do your best to replace these nouns with **more precise categories**. You do not need to take into account all possible variables, but you do want to try to include all of those that might make a difference to your project.

	- **Verbs.** Do your questions contain *verbs* like "influence," "affect," "shape," or "impact" or *passive constructions* such as "was affected by," "responded to," or "reacted to"? In such cases, chances are high that you are building your questions in such a way that *they rule out an entire set of possible answers and outcomes.* **Rephrase to avoid presumptions** that could result in confirmation bias.



**Common Mistakes**:

- Asking **leading questions**, which are phrased so as to **predetermine the answer**.
  
  These questions are motivated by ***unproven assumptions***, and result in ***confirmation bias***. The result of leading questions is that you inevitably find what you are looking for. 
  
- Asking **advocacy questions**, which promote a certain ideology (taken-for-granted worldview) or course of action.
  
  These questions ***take a position*** and *encourage others to adopt it*, *irrespective of the actual facts* of the case or which interpretations the evidence suggests are plausible. 
  
- **Forcing all your questions to "make sense" or "add up."** Donâ€™t worry. That part will come soon.
