## Exercise: Change One Variable

- The **goal**: To distinguish between the **problem** and a ***case of the problem***. To identify which **components** of a research question are *indispensable* to that question, and are thus most **indicative** of the underlying research problem you are trying to solve. You will then be better able to **identify other studies** that share your Problem.

	1. Begin by *writing down* your research ***questions*** as **specifically** as you can, in whatever form they are currently in.
	   
	2. Each question should contain as many of the following variables as possible:
		- Time
		- Place
		- Agent/Subject
		- Object
		- Hypothesis
		  
	3. Starting with this formulation of the question, we can use a technique that involves **changing the question** *methodically*, **one variable at a time**.
	   
	4. Each time you change one variable, *ask yourself these questions*:
		- *"Do I **care more or less**?"*
		- *"Is something **lost or gained**?"*
		- *"If I had to guess, **why** have things changed (or not)?"*
		- *"Is the way I wrote my question as **honest** and **comprehensive** as it could be? Is this my **complete question**, or is it **missing a variable**?"*
		  
	5. Write down, next to each "***changed variable***," a few notes that capture what is going on **inside your mind**. 
	   
	6. After youâ€™ve run through a series of **permutations**, take stock of the process by **categorizing** all of your variables into these *two categories*. 
		- **Negotiable or fungible variables**. These variables can be changed ***without influencing your level of interest***. 
		  
		- **Non-negotiable variables**. These variables, when changed, lead to the ***evaporation** of **all interest**, even when (ostensibly) your topic is still present*.
		  
	7. Ask yourself these questions:
		- *"When I see this list of **negotiable versus nonnegotiable variables**, what does my **problem really** seem to be?"*
		  
		- "***Why** is it that I seem **unconcerned** with **some variables being changed**, while others seem **sacred**?*"
		  
		- *"When **more than one non-negotiable** is left over, which one is **dominant**?"*
		  
		- *"**Which** is the **problem**, and which is the **case of the problem**? Put another way, is X a case of Y, or is Y a case of X?"*
		  
		- *"Does my **question**, the way I first posed it, really **capture my Problem**, or is it simply a **case** of my Problem?"*
		  
		- *"If the latter, might there be a way for me to **rephrase my question** such that, while it **remains as specific as before**, it comes closer to articulating the **core issues** in my work?"*


**Common Mistakes**:

- **Making substitutions that are far too small**, and choosing *new variables* that are **far too similar**, to meaningfully test the importance of the variable to your research interests.
  
- Skipping the steps of **assessing which variables are negotiable** (meaning that *the revised question is of equal or greater interest to you than the original one*) and which **non-negotiable** (meaning that *your **interest** in the research question **drops or disappears** if you change the variable*.)
  
- Making substitutions that are **impossible**, **illogical** (e.g., anachronistic), or **otherwise untenable** because they are not supported by fact.
  
- Not writing down your assessments of which variables are *negotiable or non-negotiable.*
  
- Applying the problem/case distinction **only to your work**, instead of also using it to **identify members} of your Problem Collective *in other fields***
