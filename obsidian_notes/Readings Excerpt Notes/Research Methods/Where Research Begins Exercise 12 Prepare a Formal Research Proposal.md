## Exercise: Prepare a Formal Research Proposal

- The **goal**: To catalyze all of the "potential energy”" you’ve been building up thus far, by writing a ***formal, forward-looking prospectus*** about your *project-in-the-making*, where you try to **persuade** someone to support your work.
  
- This *research prospectus* will also bring into even **sharper focus** your **assumptions** right now about what other people might find compelling about your study.[^1] 
  
-  For this exercise, you’re going to take the **self-dialogue** you’ve been having and turn it ***outward***, **explaining** your project to an *imaginary reader* in as **coherent** and **persuasive** a manner as you can at this point.  And you’re going to do it all *before you’re ready.* 

- *The polish will come later*. For now, what you need most of all is to ***articulate**, in written form, your **earliest thoughts** on a subject.*  **Your agenda**. So try this: 
    
	- Prepare a **research grant proposal** in which you articulate a research **question** and argue that *someone should give you money to answer it.* 
	   
	- Force yourself to be ***clear** and **concise*** by writing a formal document, within *tight constraints*:
		- 4–6 double-spaced pages
		- 1-inch margins
		- Times New Roman, 12-point font
		- **Due in one week** (to be submitted to yourself only!)
		  
- The research proposal should contain the following **four parts**:
	- **Contextual framework**. You need to equip your reader by explaining (succinctly but thoroughly) the ***essential knowledge and frames of reference*** that they will need to understand the facts of your proposed research and appreciate its potential significance.
	  
	- **Goals and objectives**. State the *questions* you propose to answer using *primary source archival materials*.
	  
	- **Significance**. Based on your current understanding of your chosen area of analysis, *explain the significance of your proposed questions.* [^2]
	  
	- **Project plan**. 
		- Provide a **detailed methodology** that will enable you to achieve your project goals. 
		- Provide a **logistical plan**, including your *timeline and list of project milestones*.


**Common Mistakes**:

- **Avoiding** writing this draft by using one of the oldest **procrastination tricks** in the book: *"I just need to do a little bit more research."*  Save that for later. For now, however, **think and write from where you are at this moment**.[^3]

- **Writing defensively.** Anticipate things that your reader might ask about or *challenge*, certainly, but do so in the service of **drawing attention to the potential contributions** of your project. This is the time for ***positive thinking***.
  
- Adopting a **tentative**, **unsure**, or **apologetic tone**. 
  
*When you are **envisioning** your ideal research future, do so with confidence*.

- [^1] This is definitely going to feel ***premature***, but trust us: it’s still *part of the process*.
- [^2] The **significance** of your proposal must reside in a **well-articulated, meaningful, and open-ended problem** that you have arrived at through *primary source–based (and secondary source-based) research.*
- [^3] "Start from where you are" is the leadership principle of [[Bias for Action]]
