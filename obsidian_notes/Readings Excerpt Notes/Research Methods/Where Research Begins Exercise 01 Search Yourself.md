## Exercise: Search Yourself

- The **goal**: To use a list of ***primary-source search** results* to figure out *the **aspects** of your **topic*** that **most interest you**, and **draft questions** based on these interests.

- You already know how to search the internet. This exercise prompts you to use the results of an internet search to search yourself.

- This exercise offers one way to get **from a topic to questions**:
	1. Based on the "Try This Now” exercise you completed in the introduction, **write down any and all of the research topics you are drawn to**. Feel free to be as general as possible, and to include more than one.
	  
	2. **Select one of the topics** on your list and **run a search** using at least three (or more) of the web-based databases listed below. 
	  
	3. Click on **a few of the search results that *interest* you** -- say, five to ten.
	  
	4. ***Don’t read the search results in depth***. Instead, your goal is to dedicate perhaps **20 percent** of your mental energy to **scanning** the list of search results (and perhaps the contents of a few) and the remaining **80 percent** of your mental energy to **self-observation**. You want to *read yourself* as you *read the results*.
	  
	5. In particular, pay close attention to how your **mind** and **body** are responding to different search results:
		- Which ones seem to ***jump out at you***?
		- Which ones cause you to ***linger** just a split second longer*?
		- Which ones ***quicken your pulse**, even slightly*?
		  
	6. **Write down at least ten entries** that attract you, *without worrying about why they do*.
	  
	7. Based on this list of ten entries, **answer the three questions above** about those entries, to generate ***self-evidence***.
	  
	8. ***Sleep on it*** (take a break of at least twenty-four hours).
	  
	9. **Return** to the **answers you wrote out** and **ask yourself**: (Question your questions [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 3]])
		- *If I didn’t know the person who wrote these answers, or flagged these search results as "interesting," what kinds of guesses would I make about this researcher?* 
		  
		- *What story does this "self-evidence" seem to tell about the researcher, in terms of their concerns and interests?*
		  
	- **Write down your thoughts on these questions**, getting as much down on paper as possible.



**Common Mistakes**:

- Not writing things down
  
- ***Getting bogged down in individual sources too soon***
  
- **Excluding** "*fluke*" search results that *seem unrelated to the keywords* you entered in the database or unrelated to your topic
  
- **Feigning interest** in a search result that seems "*important*," *even if it doesn’t really interest you*
  
- Only registering interest in search results for which *you think you know why you’re interested in them*, instead of being more **inclusive**.
  
- **Trying** to make a list of noticings that is ***coherent*** and *fits together*
  
- When speculating about *why* a search result jumped out at you, ***worrying about whether or not the reason is "important," based on some imagined external standard***
