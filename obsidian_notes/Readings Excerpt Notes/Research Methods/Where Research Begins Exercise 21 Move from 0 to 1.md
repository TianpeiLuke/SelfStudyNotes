## Exercise: Move from 0 to 1

- The **goal**: To create a **"Draft 1"** -- a document with a (very) *preliminary sense of structure* -- by making an initial pass at **sorting, grouping, and editing** your consolidated writings from Draft 0. [^1]
  
	1. **Combine** things that *obviously go together*.
	   
	2. Move all **bibliographic entries** to the **end** of the document.
	   
	3. **Experiment** with combining things that *might go together.* [^2]  
	   
	   **Cut and paste** those things into the same part of the document, and *see what happens.*
	   
	4. Pay attention to **"self-evidence"** as you *rearrange chunks of your document.* 
	   
	   Listen for ***any new thoughts, questions, phrasings, or ideas*** that crop up while you do this, and make sure to **write these ideas into Draft 1.** Think about where makes the most sense. 
	   
	5. Where possible, put those chunks into a ***rough** sequence.* If parts of your document seem out of order, **reorder** them. 
	   
	   Likewise, if you discover that three of your chunks all deal with a **shared theme**, try *grouping those chunks into their own section* -- just to see what happens.
	   
	6. Add **titles** to **sections** of the document.  This kind of **envisioning** is a continual part of the research process, and it applies not only to *the title of your work in progress*, but also to *the sections inside of it*.
	   
	7. Develop your **writerly voice.**  *Draft 1* is a good time to begin thinking about **your voice as a writer**. Become aware of the way that ***figurative language*** commits us to arguments that we might be unaware of. 
	   
	8. **Keep killing your acronyms.** Be vigilant about *insider language* throughout the rewriting process.
	   
	9. Add **footnotes, endnotes**, or other necessary **citations.** 
		- Start the process of **tracking your sources** of information systematically. 
		  
		- Choose a single ***formatting style** for references* that you will use throughout the project, and make sure to apply it uniformly.

## Recommended Notes

- [^1] Use **Zettelkasten** to keep all notes in one place including excepts, literature notes, highlights, thoughts and ideas, questions, problems; Also to connect them via link. [[How to Take Smart Note Book Summary]].
- [^2] Letâ€™s say you perceive a **possible connection** between different parts of your notes, but one that is *not obvious or straightforward.* Maybe three fragmentary notes seem to orbit around a **common theme** that you might want to use as a *key structural device in your Problem.
