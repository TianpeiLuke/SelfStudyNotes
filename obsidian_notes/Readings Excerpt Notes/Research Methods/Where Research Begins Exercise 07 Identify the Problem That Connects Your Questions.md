## Exercise: Identify the Problem That Connects Your Questions

- The **goal**: To  **identify the problem** underlying your multiple draft research **questions**

- Try this procedure:

	1. Lay all of your questions out in front of you.
	   
	2. *Do not try to answer all those questions for now*. Instead, ask yourself:
	   
	   *"What are **the shared concerns** that **connect** these questions?"*
	   
	3. **Step outside yourself**. 
	   
	   *If you were someone else looking at these questions, what might you speculate are the **deeper questions that connect these small questions?***
	   
	4. Write down those questions. 
	   
	5. If necessary, ***prioritize** your questions by **degree of specificity or generality**, as **medium-level** or **high-level** questions.* 
	   
	   These questions should be *more general than the specific factual questions* you generated earlier.


**Common Mistakes**:

- Trying to **answer your multiple questions,** instead of focusing on ***identifying the shared concern*** that underlies them.
  
- *Not **thinking beyond the particular topic or case***, and *ignoring a more **fundamental concern***.
