## Engaging Change - Transform Yourself

- **The unchanging element is change** -- by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. 

	- *Definition of Insanity: Doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome.*
	  
	- And now for something **completely different**.
	  
	  *people who **perform better** can be viewed as actually **doing a different task**, **rather than doing the same task better***.
	  
	  Instead of thinking, "_Do it better,_" think ***"Do it differently."***

	- **Messing things up**. Often *the most profound advances* you can make in your life come through ***experiences that challenge the life you have***. 
	  
	- You can turn **doubt** into a comfortable and insightful **guide** along the road to true change.

- ***Change** is the **universal constant** that allows you to get the most out of living and learning*.
