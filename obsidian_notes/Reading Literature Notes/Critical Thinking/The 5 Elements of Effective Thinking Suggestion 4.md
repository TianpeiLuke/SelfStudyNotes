## See the Flow of Ideas - Look Back, Look Forward

- Look back to see *where ideas **came from*** and then *look ahead* to discover *where those ideas may **lead***. 
  
	- To better master a subject, after you have been introduced to a new concept, **look beyond the new concept** and just **guess** what you think will **come next**.
	  
	- Once you understand a more advanced topic, a *look back* makes *earlier material easier.* The earlier material will become easier, clearer, and more meaningful because you will see **its significance through the later work that came from it**.
	  
	  The more advanced work will also be easier since you will now see how it grew from the seeds that existed in the earlier work.
	  
	- All the new ideas we have are *only **tiny variations** of what has been thought before*. 
	  
	  The difference between those who have great insights and those who don’t is that the first group actually **take those baby steps**.

- **A new idea is a beginning, not an end**. 
   
	- When you learn a new concept or master a skill, think about what **extensions**, **variations**, and **applications** are possible.

	- **The best can get even better**. Starting with what is currently the best is often the ideal place to expect great improvements.
	  
	- *Often the solution to a difficult problem comes from a **struggled focus** on the issue.* You may have to struggle to finally master an idea or a skill.  But after you have reached one level, that is where you start.
	  
	- *Once you have it*, see if you can improve it.
	  
- Ideas are **rare** -- **milk** them.
  
- Following **consequences of small ideas** can result in **big payoffs**. Compound Effect.
	- Making it practical.  **Explore the consequences several steps forward**.
		- *"What’s next?"*
		- *"If this, then that."* 
		-  *"What now?"*
		  
	- Following that flow can **highlight some fallacies** in seemingly sound schemes.
