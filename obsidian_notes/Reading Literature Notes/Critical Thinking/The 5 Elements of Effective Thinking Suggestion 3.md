##  Creating Questions out of Thin Air: Be Your Socrates

- Constantly create questions to ***clarify and extend** your understanding*. 
  
	- ***Wisdom just for the asking***. *Creating questions is as important as answering them*.
	  
	- *Generating questions* can help **direct your next steps** toward deeper understanding and creative problem solving.
	  
	- **Overcoming bias**.
	  
	- Take another look. ***Frame questions in different ways.*** Alternative perspectives lead to new sights and new insights.
	  
	- Try to ***bridge ideas** from one discipline or area to another*.
	  
	- Develop a *questionable habit*. ***Force yourself to ask questions***. 
	  
	- Be ***thought provoking***. Getting in the habit of asking questions will transform you into an ***active listener***. [^1]
	  
	  If you are constantly engaged in asking yourself questions about what you are hearing, you will find that even boring lecturers become a bit more interesting
	  
- *What’s the **real** question?*  Working on *the wrong questions* can waste a lifetime.
  
	- ***Effective questions** highlight **hidden assumptions** and indicate **directions** to take to make progress*.
	  
	- Effective question lead to **action** and are **not vague**.
	  
	- *The right questions **clarify your understanding*** and ***focus your attention on features that matter***.
	  
	-  Effective questions *expose the real issue*.
	  
	- Remember to always ***question the questions.***
	  
- *Ideas are in the air* -- the right questions will bring them out and help you ***see connections that otherwise would have been invisible.***
  
- Asking questions about an assignment or project ***before beginning work in earnest*** will always lead to a stronger final product.
