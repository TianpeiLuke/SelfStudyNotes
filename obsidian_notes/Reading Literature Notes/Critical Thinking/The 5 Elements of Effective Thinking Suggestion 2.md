## Igniting Insights through Mistakes - Fail to Succeed

- **Fail to succeed**. "Fail" is not an _obscene word_.
	- Any creative accomplishment evolves out of lessons learned from a long succession of missteps.
		  
	- ***Effective failure*** is an important, positive (and, as in the case of Microsoft, lucrative) step toward success.
		  
	- Viewing failure as an *opportunity for learning* requires a *fresh mind-set*.
		  
	- Failing *productively* involves *two basic steps*: 
		- **creating the mistake** and then 
		- **exploiting the mistake**.
			  
	- *Success is about **persisting** through the process of **repeatedly failing** and **learning from failure***.
		  
	- Give credit to failure.
		  
- ***Intentionally get it wrong** to inevitably get it even more right.* 
	- A specific mistake is an excellent **source of insight and direction**.
		  
	- ***You may not know how to do it right, but you can certainly do it wrong*** . 
	  
	  A good way to generate *useful mistakes* is simply to tackle the issue at hand by ***quickly constructing the best solution you can with little or no effort***. Don’t stare at a blank screen.  [[Bias for Action]]
		  
	- ***Incremental approach***: try something; see what’s wrong; learn from the defect; try again.
		  
	- *Going to the **extreme***. *Deliberately* exaggerating or considering extreme, impractical scenarios often frees us to have an unforeseen insight.
	  
- **Mistakes are great teachers** -- *they **highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes** in your understanding*. 
	- Learning from other’s missteps.
	
- *They also show you which way to **turn next**, and they **ignite your imagination***.
  
	- Sometimes when your attempt fails to resolve one issue, you might discover that you have actually ***found an imaginative answer to a totally different question***.
	  
	- What separates the good from the *great* is ***how we react to that bad day***.
	  
- Failure and mistake has its own *cost* and its *impact*. If possible, *making mistake and failure as early as possible* when the cost is low.
