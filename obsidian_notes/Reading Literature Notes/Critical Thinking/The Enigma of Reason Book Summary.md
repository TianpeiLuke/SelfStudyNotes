## Book Summary

>[!summary]
>This book challenges traditional views of human reason, arguing that *reason* did *not evolve* primarily for *individual problem-solving* or *truth-seeking*. Instead, they propose that reason evolved as a **social tool** to *justify actions*, *convince others*, and *evaluate arguments* within a group.
>
>- The authors argue that reason is not primarily about cold, logical analysis but is deeply rooted in *social interaction*. 
>- Rather than expecting individuals to be perfectly *rational thinkers*, we should *foster environments* where argumentation and discussion refine reasoning *collectively*.
