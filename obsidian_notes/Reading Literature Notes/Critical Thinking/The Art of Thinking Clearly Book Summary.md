## Book Summary

- This book complies a list of **cognitive bias** and **logical fallacies**, each with stories and explanations. It also covers some topics in **social psychology** and **behavior economics**. 


>[!quote]
>So, forget about the "left and right brain" that semi-intelligent self-help books describe. Much more important is the difference between intuitive and rational thinking. Both have legitimate applications. **The intuitive mind is swift, spontaneous, and energy-saving**. **Rational thinking is slow, demanding, and energy-guzzling** (in the form of blood sugar). Nobody has described this better than the great Daniel Kahneman in "Thinking, Fast and Slow." [[Thinking, Fast and Slow Book Summary]]

## How to Avoid Fallacies and Bias?

>[!quote]
>Since I started to collect cognitive errors, people often ask me how I manage to live an error-free life. The answer is: *I don't*. In fact, **I don't even try**. Just like everybody else, I make snap decisions by consulting not my thoughts but my feelings. For the most part, I **substitute the question** *"What do I think about this?"* with *"How do I feel about this?"* *Quite frankly, anticipating and avoiding fallacies is a costly undertaking.*
>
>To make things simple, I have set myself the following rules: In situations where the possible consequences are large (i.e., important personal or business decisions), I try to be as reasonable and rational as possible when choosing. I take out my list of errors and check them off one by one, just like a pilot does. ... Thinking is tiring. Therefore, if the potential harm is small, don't rack your brains. ... Nature doesn't seem to mind if our decisions are perfect or not, as long as we can maneuver ourselves through lifeâ€”and *as long as we are ready to be rational when it comes to the crunch*. And there's one other area where I let my **intuition take the lead**: when I am in my **"circle of competence."**

>So, find out where your **circle of competence** is. Get a clear grasp of it. Hint: It's smaller than you think. If you face a consequential decision *outside that circle*, *apply the hard, slow, rational thinking*. For everything else, give your intuition free rein.
