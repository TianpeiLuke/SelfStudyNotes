## Grounding Your Thinking - Understand Deeply

- **Understand Fundamentals Deeply.** Don’t face complex issues head-on; *first understand **simple ideas** deeply*. 
	- **What is deep understanding?** In everything you do, refine your skills and knowledge about fundamental concepts and simple cases. Once is never enough. As you revisit fundamentals, you will find new insights.
		  
	- A **commonsense approach** leads to the core. 
		  
	- To learn any subject well and to create ideas beyond those that have existed before, return to the basics repeatedly.
		  
	- When faced with a *difficult challenge -- **don’t do it!***  When the thing gets tough, creative problem solvers *create an **easier, simpler problem** that they can solve*. Focus entirely on solving a subproblem that you know you can successfully resolve.

- **Clear the clutter** and *expose what is really important*. 
	- ***Uncover the essence***.  By *systematically ignoring one distraction after another*, you can turn your attention to more central (often initially invisible) themes.
		  
- ***Be brutally honest*** about what you know and don’t know. 
	- Acknowledging and then letting go of bias and prejudice can lead you to see what’s truly there and (often more importantly) to discover what’s missing. 
			  
	- *What everybody believes is not always what’s actually true*.
			  
	- How do you know? *Becoming aware of the **basis** of your **opinions or beliefs*** is an important step toward a better understanding of yourself and your world.
			  
		What is the evidence that your understanding is based upon? Become aware of the ***sources** of your opinions*.
			  
- **See what’s missing**. *identify the **gaps**, and fill them in*. 
	- One of the most profound ways to see the world more clearly is to *look deliberately for the gaps* -- the *negative pace*, as it is called in the art world; that is, the space surrounding the objects or issues of interest.
		  
	- Add the adjective and uncover the gaps.
			  
- Let go of ***bias**, **prejudice**, and **preconceived notions***. [^1]
	  
- There are ***degrees** to understanding* (it’s not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. 
	
- *Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success.*
