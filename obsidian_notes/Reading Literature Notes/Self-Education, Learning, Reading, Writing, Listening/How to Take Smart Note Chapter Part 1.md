## Part 1 Zettelkasten method

- **Writing is the medium of thinking, learning and researching.** The way we organize our writing,  the way we take notes on our thinking and how we use our notes makes a lot difference between an effective thinker/writer/researcher and an ineffective one. 
  
- **Writing rarely starts from scratch.** Most of work should have done **before** writing get started. **Taking smart notes** is critical to collect information, organize our thoughts, deepen our understanding in order for developing clear argument in our final draft. 
  
- The same principle applies to research. *The quality of research paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.* 
  
- **The Zettelkasten (Slip-box) method** provides ***an effective tool*** in note-taking that enables **a clear structure** for *writing, note-taking, thinking and research*. It is a system that allows us to **maintain a long term memory** of important information. It enables a *flow of ideas* and information.
  
- This part presents the Zettelkasten method, including **its format**, **organization** and **workflow**. See details in [[How to Take Smart Note Workflow]]
  
- Here are some additional key points in this part:
	- A big mistake in *early phase of research* is to start with planning. **Early planning** in research would *impose structure* on our mind, making us inflexible toward new ideas and new results during our research.  
	  
	- To deal with the complexity of research, the best way is to **keep things as simple as possible.** We need focus on thinking and understanding, instead of formatting, organization and connections. 
	  
	- Zettelkasten method presents a simple unified format of **atomic writing**, an non-hierarchical organization that facilitates **interconnection** between notes and thoughts, and an efficient trustworthy overarching **workflow** that guarantees that all information for research and writing is taken care of. 
	  
	- The author compare with the popular ***GTD method*** in project management and planning. [^1] He stated that due to high uncertainty and non-linearity in the process of research and insightful writing, GTD method itself seldom works. But the idea behind GTD, which is to build a simple clear structure and an overarching workflow that handles the daily routine, would work. 
	  
	- Zettelkasten method is different from GTD method in details but the idea of both methods are similar. The idea is to *build a system that we can trust* that incorporate all information we need so that *our brain can let it go* and *focus on thinking.*
	  
	- **Writing** can be done easy if an initial draft has been presented. And **drafting** can be easy if we have already collected all materials, ideas and references etc. and we have already sorted in sequential order. **Sorting** existing notes in order would be easy too esp. when a partial ordering exists among notes. 
	  
	- The essence of Zettelkasten method is to **build writing/thinking from bottom-up, beginning with atomic notes.** Then writing process becomes:
		1. assemble notes in order
		2. turn ordered notes into draft
		3. review and revise draft

 [^1]: A successful organization should have a **holistic perspective**: everything needs to be taken care of within the system. This is the idea presented in *Getting Things Done*. See  [[Getting Things Done Book Summary]]. In this book, the author states that **GTD cannot directly be applied in research and insightful writing since research is mostly non-linear process.** Therefore, at the early phase of research it is impossible to *define the objective clearly*. Moreover, GTD requires research activities to be broken down into concrete *Next Steps*. It is also difficult in research to anticipate what next step to take beforehand.
