## Part 2 The Four Underlying Principles

- **Writing Is the Only Thing That Matters.** This section discuss the importance of writing thing down during reading, learning and researching.[^1]  Zettelkasten method *focuses on writing as if nothing else counts.*
  
	- Writing is *required* in academia since all results of research need to go *public* to facilitate knowledge sharing. 
	  
	- **Focus on writing does not mean to spend less time reading or joining discussions**. In fact, it is critical to read and to participate in presentations, conference etc. to collect new ideas, to learn new knowledge, to exchange ideas with others. 
	  
	- Instead, we need to have **a clear tangible purpose while we are reading, learning or discussing.** To be effective learner is to capture the essence of the material, the main arguments and supporting materials and to **raise effective questions**. It is these questions from us that we are writing down. By writing down the underlying arguments from the book, we are able to **distinguish good argument from the bad argument** and thus deepen our understanding.[^1]  
	  
	- **Writing improve our understanding and memory**. In order to write it down in our own word, we need to understand the meaning of material ourselves. This process of ***elaboration*** will **improve our long term memory.**  [[Zeigarnik Effect]]
	  
	- Focus on writing would let us **think differently**. *You also have to think beyond the things you read, because you need to turn it into something new.* 
	  
	- The skills of reading with purpose would be enhanced with **deliberate practice**.
	  
- **Simplicity Is Paramount.** *More often than not, it is the simplicity of an idea that makes it so powerful.*
  
	- **Traditional note-taking systems** are unnecessarily **complicated.** Notes are *scattered everywhere* and are in *different formats* (highlights, margins, notebooks, excerpts). It thus puts a great amount of stress and burden on our brain to remember where to find relevant information. Hence the term ***"brainstorming"***. Moreover, these notes are ***organized in top-down manner by topics*** which is not flexible to associate with our own problems and ideas. And when more information are collected, the topic oriented organization would be ***messy*** and ***inefficient.*** 
	   
	- **The Zettelkasten system** is much **simpler**: *everything goes into the **same slip-box** and is **standardised** into the same format.* Also it is organized via links between notes. Same note can be reused in multiple projects and can be associated with multiple questions and problems. The more information we gathered in slip-box, the more powerful it becomes. 
	  
	- Zettelkasten preserves our long term memory in notes. This allows us to focus on **thinking** instead of **remembering**. We do not need to worry about forgetting. 
	  
	- Even Zettelkasten system would loss its efficiency if we add information *indiscriminately*. **Being selective** in writing notes is also crucial to maintain the relevancy and effectiveness of the note-taking system. This section also present the concept of ***a critical mass***, which depends not only on **the number of notes**, but also their **quality** and **the way they are handled**.
	  
	- To achieve a *critical mass*, it is crucial to ***distinguish clearly between three types of notes**: fleeting notes, permanent notes and project notes.* Each type of notes has its ***role***, its ***purpose*** and its ***life-cycle*** and we make sure that we regularly review our system to handle these notes accordingly.[^2]  We need to avoid *confusion* among the different *categories of notes* while writing. 
	  
- **Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch.** *Every intellectual endeavor begins with something already existed* [^3]. We then transforms the existing preconditions into something new with further inquires. The Zettelkasten system is able to prepare us with enough self-evidence in flexible non-linear way before we start working on our draft.
  
	- ***Decide what to write before writing** is either **misleading or banal.*** Before you have immersed yourself in the topics at hands, it is not possible to make a sound plan on what to write. To plan on what to write before start writing would loss us the chance of information accumulation. [^6]
	  
	- We should be guided by **our interest, curiosity and intuition**,[^1] which is developed by reading, writing, discussing, thinking, and is something that **continuously grows** and *reflects our knowledge and understanding **externally***.
	  
	- By *keeping track of what we are interested in the written form*, questions and arguments will **rise naturally** from the materials. This is so-called ***"self-evidence"***. [^1]
	  
	- If we see ***clusters*** of notes built up in the slip-box, we can see directly both the **current topics** that we are working on as well as **possible future topics**. 
	  
	- The term ***"brainstorming"*** is a *misnomer*. Those that we are supposed to find in our head are not originally from there and ***our brain is neither objective or reliable***. All information we need comes from reading, discussing and listening based on *external materials*. 
	  
	- **Writing is not linear process.** Taking smart note would *break the linearity*. Instead of thinking about topics, we can easily *see* effective questions and develop our ideas and interests while reading. Taking smart note is part of a *structured workflow* that helps to form a habit of **thinking in writing**. 
	  
	- Those have developed **the habit of thinking in writing** would be able to focus on *what is interesting to them at the moment* and to *accumulate enough materials* by doing what they most feel like doing. [^4] Thus, instead of spending time worrying about what topic to write for, we focus on **your already existing interests** and **doing what is necessary to make informed decisions** – **reading, thinking and writing
	  
- **Let the Work Carry You Forward.** *Once we get into the **workflow**, it is as if the work itself **gains momentum**, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us. This is the kind of **dynamic** we are looking for.*
  
	- A good **workflow** can easily turn into a ***virtuous circle,*** where the *positive experience* motivates us to take on the next task *with ease*, which helps us to *get better at what we are doing*, which in return makes it more likely for us to *enjoy* the work, and so on.
	  
	- Any attempts to use ***external reward*** to maintain our habits of writing is only *short-term solutions* with no prospect of developing *long term habits*.[^4] Only when our workflow establish a ***positive feedback loop*** can the dynamic of **motivation and reward** become **self-sustainable** and propel the whole process forward. Our workflow is the environment that determined our habit development. 
	  
	- **Feedback loop is critical for habit development**. And this applies to learning process as well. The experience of becoming better motivates us to continue improve. Thus we need to **actively seek and welcome feedback** [^1] and use it as a chance to improve. This is the basis of success in long run.  
	  
	- **Embracing a *growth mindset*** means to get pleasure out of **changing for the better** (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding).[^5]
	  
	- Besides having a growth mindset, we also need to have a **learning system** that allow you to implement *multiple positive feedback loops*. It helps us to *correct our mistakes* and to increase the number of opportunities to learn.
	  
	- **Zettelkasten method** is a systems enables *positive feedback loops*:
		- It enforces us to write down what we learned in our own words. This way we can examine if we have thought through about the materials. 
		  
		- By putting new permanent notes with existing notes, it can show us **contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions**.
		  
		- Our slip-box grows as more notes come in and it becomes more *knowledgeable*. It serve the role where the **peer reviews and supervisors cannot serve**.  
		  
		- Working with slip-box is less about **retrieving specific notes** but about **generating insights** and building **connection** between a note and its relevant facts. This interconnection allows the **usability** of slip box to *grow **exponentially*** with the number of notes. With this growing complexity, we may find unexpected information while we are searching a note in this system. 
		  
	- **Facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion.** With an increasing amount of connected information in the system, it makes **understanding new concept** and **remembering** it much easier.

[^1]: The importance of writing our ***self-evidence*** down while doing research is discussed in [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]] Also this book stress the importance of ***leaving the Topic Land*** which is one of the benefits of using Zettelkasten. It also discuss the importance of seeking feedbacks from *Sounding board*. 
 [^2]: Check more on different categories of notes, their purpose and role and the workflow that handles them in [[How to Take Smart Note Workflow]].
[^3]: ***Progressive improvement*** and innovation has been discussed in *Flow of Ideas* [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 4]]
[^4]: Consider how the smart note and an interconnected system can serve as a **cue** to the development of a habit of ***"thinking in writing"***. Also check on the importance of "**make it satisfying**" in maintain long term habits. We can also check on the debate on the importance of ***motivation vs. environment*** in habit forming.
