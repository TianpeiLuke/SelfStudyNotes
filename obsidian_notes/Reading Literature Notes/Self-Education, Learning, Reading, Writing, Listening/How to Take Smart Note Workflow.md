## Zettelkasten Method

Zettelkasten = Slip Box in German

### Note Format and Categories

- **Three Basic Types of Notes**: 
	- **Fleeting Notes**. "On-the-Fly" Notes that allow us to write *whatever we want and whenever we want.* It includes literature excerpts, quotes, pictures, webclips etc. It can be a piece of ideas, or reminders, or links to other materials. 
	  
		- Fleeting notes need not to be full sentence. It can contain only keywords. 
		  
		- As name suggests, fleeting notes can be dropped after a while. It serves as a **reminder**. We make sure that important information does not stay in inbox too long (1-2 days). 
		  
		- All of fleeting notes need to be processed and transformed into other type notes (literature notes, permanent notes, project notes etc.). Only our own thoughts are kept for long turn. 
	  
	- **Literature Notes**. Literature notes summarizes/paraphrases the literature that we read. It translates the words from external sources into words of our own. We write full sentence with clear reference (links, bibliographical references). 
	  
		- Literature notes are meant to be the reference to original material. So keep a **full bibliographical references**.
		  
		- Literature notes need to be written **in our own words.** It either paraphrases or summarizes the material we read and learn. This is a key process of learning and remembering. Only by reading and writing out of our own memory can be really ***test** our **comprehension and understanding** of the material want to take note of.*
		  
		- **Be selective** in writing literature notes. Only choose literature that ***interests you*** instead of trying to impress some external judges.[^1] Only collect information that we **want to remember** or those we are interested in. 
		  
		- Be aware of **confirmation bias**. To reduce bias and prejudice, we should also include literature notes that contradicts our ideas. 
	  
	- **Permanent Notes**. Permanent notes are called zettels (slip note). It collects the ideas of our own based on our reading and thinking. We also check the relevance of new notes to existing notes. Then we connect new notes with old ones to form a graph. New ideas would pop up through its connection. 
	  
		- Permanent notes are meant to be **atomic, concise and complete** so that if we read it after forgetting all materials we would still understand it. So keep the reference link, write in full sentence. Also one permanent note for one idea. Maintain the atomic nature of this note.  
		  
- **Index Notes.** Index notes contain **a collection of links to other notes.** They are **entry point** towards a specific topic, sub-topic and genres. Index notes make sure that we can retrieve all relevant information easily. Index notes can also be used as an **overview** of the topics. Furthermore, it provide an **ordering** to materials and thoughts which can be used in drafting. 
  
- **Project Notes.** Project notes contain project related materials. They are kept together with other project-related notes in a project-specific folder. Sometimes project notes for one project can be reused for other projects. We can keep an index note for each project that connects to all project notes.Then we can sort them, rearrange them according to our needs. It doesn’t matter in which format these notes since they are going to be **discarded or archived when the project is completed**. 
  
  Project-related notes can be: 
	- *comments in the manuscript*
	- *collections of project-related literature*
	- *outlines*
	- *snippets of drafts*
	- *reminders*
	- *to-do lists*
	- and of course *the draft itself*.

### Additional Suggestions regarding Note Format:

- Avoid **confusion** of different note types. Each type of notes has its own purpose, its role as well as its life-cycle. Not every note need to maintain in the system. 
  
- **Do not treat every note as permanent note.** 
  
  >[!quote] 
  >*The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight.*

- **Do not only collect notes related to a specific project.** A project would end in one day. That means that everything you found, thought or encountered during the time of a project will be lost. Without a permanent storage that keep information between projects, you have to ***start all over again*** after each project and cut off all other promising lines of thought. At that moment, we have to rely on *our own capacity of memory or the length of project* to keep relevant information.

- **Do not take fleeting notes if you know you will not go back to review them.** Highlights and margins are all fleeting notes. 

- **Fleeting notes are only useful if we processed them into proper notes within a day or two.** Information in fleeting notes should be extracted with context and additional efforts have to be made in order to grasp the main ideas behind the material. It is crucial to **elaborate ideas** from fleeting materials as soon as possible so that they can be kept for long term. *A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is **when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal**. In the first case, you forgot what it was supposed to **remind you of**. In the second case, you **forgot the context** that gave it its meaning.*
  
- The information and ideas in **permanent notes** need to be **elaborated** enough so that it has potential to be used as inspiration in drafting. Its relevancy to the future thinking can be determined later. 
  
- **Do not write a note just to fill in a gap in the note sequences.** Slip-box is not encyclopedia. Only write note if it helps with our own thinking. 
  
- **A few wisely chosen notes are sufficient for each index note.** The quicker we get from the index to the concrete notes, the quicker we move our attention from **mentally preconceived ideas towards the fact-rich level of interconnected content**, where we can conduct a fact-based dialogue with the slip-box.

 - **We don’t need to have an overview of slip-box itself,** since there are more than one topics in it.  
   
 - As a system to **think with**, the references **between the notes** are much more important than the references **from the index to a single note**. 

- The author also discuss on how to **read** and **write the literature notes**:
	- The main point is "*everything is about building up a **critical mass of useful notes** in the slip-box, which gives us a **clear idea** of **how to read and how to take literature notes."***
	  
	- *Without a **clear purpose for the notes**, taking them will feel more like a chore than an important step within a bigger project.*	
	   
	- The purpose of taking literature notes to **grasp and understand the text.**
	  
	- When reading and note-taking, the only **criterion** is the question of **whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box.** 
	  
	- Writing literature notes would help to keep an eye on the insights and the line of thoughts that may end up in slip-box. 
	  
	- Writing permanent notes to an audience who is **ignorant of the thoughts behind the text** and **unaware of the original context**, only equipped with a general knowledge of the field. 
	  
	- The extent of details in literature notes depend on the **text** and **our needs**. It also depends on the *complexity* of the text, the *difficulty* in understanding and our *ability* to summarize it concisely. In more challenging case, more elaborate notes would be more useful. In easier case, we can just keep the keywords. 
	  
- Some discussions regarding using **index note** and **keywords:**
	- In the Zettelkasten, *keywords* can easily be added to a note like **tags** and will then show up in the index. *They should be chosen **carefully and sparsely.*** 
		  
	- **A few wisely chosen notes are sufficient for each entry point.** The quicker we get from the index to the concrete notes, the quicker we move our attention from **mentally preconceived ideas towards the fact-rich level of interconnected content**, where we can conduct a fact-based dialogue with the slip-box.
		  
	- **Every consideration on the structure of a topic is just another consideration on a note** – bound to change and dependent on the development of our understanding.
		  
	- When choosing keywords,  consider "*In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it?*"
		  
	- Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, **never by looking at the note in isolation.** Good keywords are usually not already mentioned as words in the note.
		  
	- Assigning keywords itself is a thinking process.


### Organization and Systems

- **Two Systems**: 
	- **Literature Reference System**: where you keep your *literature notes* and copy of papers. 
	- **Permanent Note System (Slip Box)**: where you keep your *permanent notes* and *index notes*. 
	  
- **Inbox** for Fleeting Notes, Notifications etc.
  
- **Project Folder** to save project specific information.
  
- **Index Card Folder**. Index cards are **entry point** of a **topic**, **subtopic** or a **genre** of questions. Index card mainly keeps *links to other notes* and *arranges them in a specific order.*


### Workflow

- **Collect** all that come up to our mind into **fleeting notes**, when we read, write, think. Write notes when our interests are raised. Be aware of your feeling in the process. Keep fleeting notes in **Inbox** folder.
  
- **Process** fleeting notes by summarizing or paraphrasing the material or idea behind them. When reading books, papers, etc, we can skip fleeting notes to directly write literature notes. Write down what you don't want to forget and things that you might use in future into **literature notes.** Add *full bibliography* to the literature note as precise as possible. Be *selective* when adding a literature note to our system. **Archive** literature notes in **literature reference system.** 
  
- **Reflect** on the literature note and fleeting note we write and write down *our ideas and questions* in **permanent notes.** Thinking about how the new note may be related to our interests, research etc.[^1] 
	- *"Does the new information contradicts, supports or adds to existing ideas?"*
	- *"Can we bridge different ideas to generate new idea?"*
	- *"What questions are triggered by this new information?"*
  
- **Add** permanent notes in the **slip-box** by
	- Deciding where new permanent note fits the best. **Numbering the note** with some rules defining the partial ordering.[^2]
	- **Adding a new link** to the existing relevant notes; It is ok if this note is unique and not connected to others.
	- Adding a new note link to **index card** or other cards that serve as **entry point** if necessary. 
  
- **Review** the existing permanent notes in the slip box. 
	- **Traverse** through connected permanent notes. Use **effective thinking skills** such as 
		- raising effective questions, 
		- identifying flows of ideas and 
		- understanding what is there and what is missing[^3] 
		to generate new questions and ideas. Write new fleeting/permanent notes while thinking. 
	  
	- **Organize** related ideas into *topics*, *problems* or *genres of questions*. The process of traversing helps us to figure out aspects of topic that most interest us. Given that we have already written down pieces of ideas, questions and its reference, what is left is to gather and to sort them together. Write an **index note** for the organized related ideas. 
	  
		- We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid) **overview** over a topic or subtopic just by **making another note**. If we then link from the index to such a note, we have a good entry point. When making *changes to the structure of topic*, we can **create a new note** with a new structure. Then we can **change the link** in the index note to point to the new one. 
		  
		- **Keywords** can easily be added to a note like **tags** and will then show up in the index. Choose keywords based on the topic we are **working** on or **interested** in instead of its content alone. *They should be chosen **carefully and sparsely.*** Be economical with notes per keyword. 
		  
		- Note: *every consideration on the structure of a topic is just another consideration on a note* – bound to **change** and dependent on the **development of our understanding**. 
	  
- When ideas are developed far enough, **decide** on what to write about. Gather all relevant notes to the intended topic and try to arrange them in a proper order. Write down the ordered list of note links in a new **permanent/project/index note** for given topic. 
	- Look for what is redundant, what is missing.
	- Don't wait until everything is ready. 
	- Try different combinations and ordering if possible.  
	- Go back to reading and **repeat above steps if necessary.** 

- Write **first draft** by turning the connected notes into **cohesive arguments**.
	- Don't just copy the original notes. Translate them to fit the logic and narrative.
	- Detect logical fallacies and holes in argument. Revise arguments. 
  
- **Proofread** drafts and refine and evaluate arguments, reference, as well as sources.

[^1]: check on exercise for self-centered research to know **what you are interested in** and **what bored you**. Instead of trying to please some imaginative judge, our interest should come out of our own mind. Check [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]]

[^2]: **Number it consecutively**. The Zettelkasten numbers the notes automatically. “New note” will just add a note with a new number. If you click “New note sequence,” the new note will be registered at the same time as the note that follows the note currently active on the screen. But you can always add notes “behind” other notes anytime later. Each note can follow multiple other notes and therefore be part of different note sequences.
