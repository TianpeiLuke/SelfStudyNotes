## Book Summary

- *How to Take Smart Note* presents the ***Zettelkasten (slip-box) method*** [^1] as a note-taking system, which encourages an **universal simple note format** and an **interconnected note storage and retrieval system**. This method was pioneered by *Niklas Luhmann*. [^2] 
  
- The essence of *Zettelkasten method* is to **build writing/thinking from bottom-up, beginning with atomic notes.** Atomic notes are ***units** of information and thoughts*. Its **interconnection** allows us to link thoughts and its sources, to mingle different thoughts with each other, to bridge ideas. 

- **Zettelkasten method** is
	- a simple efficient **tool** of note-taking. It provides an unified format for sources, and ideas. 
	- an **organization** of notes, allowing efficient retrieval of sources and ideas
	- an **overarching workflow** that routinely handles the notes, allowing us to focus on thinking and writing, and avoiding distractions.
	- **the second brain**: [^3] an **externalization** of thoughts and thought process. Also an **objective storage** of the *long-term memory.* 
	- a set of **principles** that emphasize ***the role of writing*** in reading and learning, ***the importance of mindset of simplicity*** in understanding and creativity, ***the necessity of preparation*** before writing and ***the benefits of auto-renewal workflow*** that turns writing and thinking into *a virtuous circle*.
	  
- This book consists of three parts:
	- **What is Zettelkasten method?** This part explains **the basic concepts** and the ***practical skills (know-how)*** of note-taking using Zettelkasten method  including how to separate different types of notes (fleeting notes, literature notes and permanent notes), how to use slip-box in writing and research etc. The focus is on ***what to do*** and ***how to do***. Check summary details of part 1 in [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 1]]
	  
	- **The Four Underlying Principles**: This part focus on the principles underlying *the Zettelkasten method*. Zettelkasten method is *not simply a **skill** for note-taking but also a set of **principles and mindsets** underlying **reading, writing, critical thinking and research.*** To better use of Zettelkasten note-taking system, one should understand ***why it works.*** The principles introduced in this part helps the reader to understand **what it really matters** in note-taking, reading, writing and research. The reader can then adopt the Zettelkasten method with **flexibility**, allowing the benefits of using this method more obvious. For many, adopting Zettelkasten method would be a **paradigm shift** in their habits and perspective towards learning and thinking itself. Check on summary of part 2 in [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 2]]
	  
	- **The Six Steps to Successful Writing**: This part provides **the suggestions and steps of academia writing, learning and research**. These steps also follow the similar principles underlying ***the self-centered research principles***. [^4] and the **five elements of effective thinking**. [^5] These suggestions are also embedded in the design of Zettelkasten system which helps us to *separate different tasks*, to *focus on understanding while reading*, to *develop ideas with connections*, and to *share insights with others*. The author advocated that Zettelkasten method would lead to successful in non-fiction writing, learning, and academia research.

- A major ***criticism*** comes from the lack of further details in the first part, i.e. the know-how. Since most of readers refer to this book to learn the Zettelkasten method, it is expected that this book would provide instructions on how to build the Zettelkasten note systems, how to write fleeting notes, literature notes, and permanent notes, and how to build connections etc. Instead, the **focus** of this book is on the principles behind Zettelkasten method and its further extension to general academia writing and research methods. Many people feels that the part 2 and part 3 are merely motivation section of the part 1, which is a misunderstanding.
