## Book Chapter Summary

### Systematic Skimming or Pre-Reading

**Assumptions** 
- You do not know if you *want to read* the book or read it *analytically* 
- You have **limited time**

**Skimming or Pre-Reading** Is the *first sub level* of Inspectional Reading
- **Main Objective**: 
	- Discover whether or not the book deserves more *careful reading*
	- *Know a lot of things about a book* without reading carefully. 
		- You may know at least the author name, the genre of book
		- Place the book in proper place for your *mental card catalogue* 
		- This may be all you care about for the time being 

**Suggestions** for Skimming
- Read **Title Page** and **Preface**
	- Note *subtitles*
	- Note anything that indicates the *scope* or the *aims* of the book
	- Grasp the *Subject* and *Category* of the book
- Study the **Table of Contents** 
	- Use it as road map to understand the *structure of book*
	- Examine if it gives you a good idea of what the author is *trying to do*.
- Check the **Index**
	- Make a quick estimate of the *ranges of topics* covered in the book
	- The *books* and *authors* that are *referred* to.
	- If some *terms* are critical to you, look up at least several *cited paragraphs*. 
		- These paragraphs may contain key information or *crux* of the book
- If exists, read the **Publisher’s Blurb**
	- Authors or Publishers may try to *summarize the main points* of the book
- The above four steps give you enough information about the book
	- We can continue skim the book
- Look at **Chapters** that are *pivotal* to author’s *argument* 
	- Check if there are *summary statements* in opening and closing pages.
- **Dipping** into the book
	- Read one or two paragraphs, here and there
	- Sometimes read several pages in sequence 
	- not too much
	- Always look for *signs of main contention*
	- listening for the *basic pulsebeat* of the matter.
	- Read *the last two or three pages*
	- Read the **Epilogue** 
	- Read the last few pages of the main part of the book.


Inspectional Reading requires **active reading**. 



### Superficial Reading

Reader may have high expectations on a book, only to be disappointed.
- Too much expectations from beginning is the issue


> [!quote]
> **Rule** for *Superficial Reading*
> - In tackling a difficult book for the *first time*, **read it through without ever stopping** to look up or ponder the things you do *not understand*.
>
> — pp 36


- Pay attention to what you *can understand* 
	- Go pass the things you do not understand, you will quickly arrive at things you do understand,
- It is easy to get lost by difficult things at beginning and get stalled.
- You have much *better chance* of understanding it in the *second time*.
- Do not allow yourself to be stopped by the first difficult paragraph encountered 


Do not try to understand every word or page of difficult book at the first time.

### Speed Reading

There is *no single right speed* for reading
- The ability to **read at various speeds** and to know **which speed is appropriate** is the *ideal*.

>[!quote]
> Every book should be read **no more slowly than it deserves**, and **no more quickly** than you can read it with **satisfaction and comprehension**.
> 
> — pp 43
