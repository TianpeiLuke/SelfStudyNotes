## Part 3 The Six Steps to Successful Writing

- **Separate and Interlocking Tasks.** 
	- The **main point** in this section is that to become successful in writing, one need to 
		- **give each task our own undivided attention**;
		- **avoid multitasking**;
		- **separate different type of tasks** and **give each task the right amount of attention**
		- **be flexible to prioritize important tasks**;[^1]
		- **finish open tasks or write it down** to release *short term memory*;
		- **reduce the number of decisions** to avoid *ego depletion*.
		  
	- Regarding the disadvantages of **multitasking**, the author states that multitasking *frequently shift attention* between multiple tasks which reduce our focus on any given task. It also generate *fatigue* in our brain. Another critical issue with multitasking is ***the mere-exposure effect***, [^8] which states that people tends to **confuse familiarity with skill**. Multitasking increases familiarity towards all tasks and causes an illusion of mastery in any of these tasks. 
	  
	- The *note categorization* and *workflow* of Zettelkasten follows the above principles  of successful writing. 
	  
- **Read for Understanding.** 
	- This section provides several suggestions to enhance **understanding in reading**:
		- **Read With a Pen in Hand**:  *More often than not, reading that are not accompanied by note-taking is almost as valuable as not having read at all.*
		  
		- **Keep an Open Mind:** Understand that what we read is from the author's perspective within the context of literature. To keep an open mind is to be aware of the bias in the literature and to confront it with evidences from other sources. 
		  
		- **Get the Gist**: To extract the essence of the text (main arguments, ideas, theories as well as topic sentences etc.) from their supporting materials is the most important skill for comprehension. 
		  
		- **Learn to Read**: To a certain degree, ***learning is understanding.*** And we shall not *confuse familiarity with understanding (the mere-exposure effect)*. We can only improve our learning by testing our knowledge in the process, by retrieving it and connecting it with what we have seen before.
		  
		- **Learn by Reading**: Learning requires deliberate practice. Through writing and further elaboration on the meaning of material, the questions behind them and the connection to existing knowledge, we can better understand materials.

- **Take Smart Notes.**
	- This section covers some of topics related to smart note-taking:
		- **Make a Career One Note at a Time**: We can measure our **productivity** with the number of notes per day. Due to the atomic structure of the Zettelkasten, we can make solid progress by gradual accumulation of atomic thoughts into our external thinking network.
		  
		- **Think Outside the Brain**: Taking smart notes is a process of *thinking within the medium of writing*. [[Building a Second Brain Book Summary]]
		  
		- **Learn by not Trying**: ***Selection** is the key to build our mental model.* ***Forgetting is a blessing.*** It enables us to grasp the gist without losing in the details. As for Zettelkasten, it is also important to decide what to write as smart notes and what to include in the slip box. [^9]
		  
		- **Adding Permanent Notes to the Slip-Box**: instruction on how to add permanent notes in slip box. See more in [[How to Take Smart Note Workflow]]
		  
- **Develop Ideas.**
	- Slip box is not encyclopedia. We don’t need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence. We **only write if it helps us with our own thinking**.
	  
	- This section discuss the way to *develop ideas* and ***nurture creativity*** using Zettelkasten:
		- **Develop Topics**: It is recommended to keep index cards in slip box to allow fast retrieval of topic relevant information. Be careful and selective when choosing keywords as tags in index card. Adding a new overview note when the structure of topic is adjusted. 
		  
		- **Make Smart Connections**: Discussions on several types of connections in digital and physical Zettelkasten. It discussed the link change to accommodate an update of knowledge and understanding. [[Building a Second Brain Chapter Summary 1]]
		  
		- **Compare, Correct and Differentiate**: Comparing notes help us to spot our *bias and mistakes* in the past and to *differentiate similar concepts, cases and arguments*. It helps us to detect the *contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions* in the knowledge base, 
		  
		- **Assemble a Toolbox for Thinking**:  *It is important to not just keep a few but a broad range of **mental models** in our head.* Slip-box serves as a **toolbox** for our mental models. It keeps the scientific terms within its context. And by *delegating storage* to slip-box, we can focus on our own "***lattice of mental models***" instead of *remembering and retrieving **isolated facts***. 
		  
		- **Use the Slip-Box as a Creativity Machine**: Creativity emerges from the exchange of ideas. It is called ***"slow hunch"***.[^3]  Slip-box provides a playground where multiple different ideas mingles together. It also allows us to see the *flow of ideas* [^4] and view the small incremental changes.
		  
		- **Think Inside the Box**: The workflow of Zettelkasten liberates us from the original context of literature by means of ***abstraction and re-specification.*** Abstraction is the key to identify both creative and functionally working solutions. This section listed out many topics in *The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking*.[^4] This workflow also helps to **break our old habits of thinking** by enforcing us to transform our knowledge in written form.[^5] 
		  
		- **Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions**: By restricting ourselves in the *atomic structure of slip box* with *a standardized format*, we can reduce the number of decisions. Our ideas are forced to be as precise as possible. 
		  
	- After delegating the storage to slip box, we can:
		- focus on the **principles** behind an **idea** while we *write, add and connect notes;*
		- observe the **patterns**;
		- think beyond the *most obvious interpretation* of the note;
		- **combine** ideas and develop thoughts and arguments;
		- **elaborate** the meaning behind facts.
	  
- **Share Your Insight.**
	- With Zettelkasten, drafting is easy: we just need to outline our argument based on all relevant notes we collected in the slip box and bring it into the linearity of a manuscript. In this process, we can spot the gaps in the argument.  
	  
	- Finding topics is also easy: we can look for clusters of note which should already caught our interest during the collection stage. 
	  
	- This section discusses various topics in the research project life-cycle:
		- **From Brainstorming to Slip-box-Storming**: The benefit of Zettelkasten at early phase of research is to spot the problems of interest based on clusters in the note network. These notes are added in the slip-box because it has caught our attention and is relevant to our topics and interests.[^6] Thus a cluster of closely connected notes reveals the problem to our research. Brainstorming is no longer dependent on brain but our written notes.
		  
		- **From Top Down to Bottom Up**: *The workflow of Zettelkasten is bottom-up*. We build our ideas, arguments and mental models on top of *atomic thoughts and facts.* These atomic thoughts and facts are embedded in the notes we accumulated throughout the daily reading and thinking.  
		  
		- **Getting Things Done by Following Your Interests**: *Motivations* are the driving force behind our research and writing. However, it is common that we may *loss interest* in the process. This is why **traditional project planning**[^2] before doing research is **subject to failure**. With the flexibility of Zettelkasten system, we can change the directions of our work opportunistically without losing the progress. 
		  
		- **Finishing and Review**: A key point is to **structure the text and keep it flexible.** Structuring the draft clearly will align our notes into linear structure. Another key point from the author is to work on **multiple projects at the same time**. This takes advantages of the existence of multiple paths in the note network. Each project may only take a subset of notes available in the slip box. We are free to drop any of them if they do not fit into our argument, knowing that none will be lost in the slip box. 
		  
		- **Becoming an Expert by Giving up Planning**: Researchers tend to *overestimate their progress* up front. This **overconfidence bias** is a natural tendency in our brain.[^7] **The lesson** learned is to be generally ***skeptical*** about planning in a research project. Things are subject to change as soon as they start working on it. Another lesson is that we can only learn from our experience if the **feedback** is received shortly after. Zettelkasten, by disassembling the challenging tasks of research and innovations into manageable smaller tasks of writing smart-notes would provide a quick feedback loop. 
		  
		- **The Actual Writing**: When the first draft is done, reviewing and revising become natural. It usually takes several rounds of drafting to reach to final version for publications. In this process, we need rigorously delete the irrelevant sentences and paragraphs to our argument.
		  
- **Make It a Habit.**[^5]
	- The workflow of Zettelkasten established a regular routine to follow. Through repeated actions, we would develop a habit of collection, a habit of critical thinking and a habit of writing. 
	  
	- Breaking old habits is hard but with the help of a system we do not need much willpower to adopt a new habit that would replace the old ones.

[^5]: This suggestion coincides with the suggestions in *Atomic Habit* which also take advantages with the compound effect of small incremental behavior change to develop habits. This suggestion would help to develop a new habit and to break an old one. See more in [[Atomic Habits Book Summary]].
[^6]: The self-centered research and interest-driven development is emphasized in [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]]
[^7]: Various biases are inherited in our brain (such as jump to conclusion, overconfidence bias, confirmation bias, feature-positive effects etc). An excellent book that discuss all of our inherited bias in brain is *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman, 2011. [[Thinking, Fast and Slow Book Summary]]
