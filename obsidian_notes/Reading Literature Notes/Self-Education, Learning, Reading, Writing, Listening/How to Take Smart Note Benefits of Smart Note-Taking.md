## The Benefits of Taking Smart Notes:

### Successful Writing

- Zettelkasten method, according to the author can achieve successful writing since:
	- It allows us to avoid distraction and focus on writing.
		  
	- Its **atomic note structure** and its **workflow** [^2] force us to ***shift attention*** to the next note ***consciously*** after finishing writing one note ***within a reasonable amount of time***. 
		  
	- Its **note categorization** (fleeting notes, literature notes, permanent notes etc.) allows us to associate different amount of attention to different type of note: fleeting notes should have the least attention, while permanent notes have the most attention. 
		  
	- Its **bottom-up organization structure** is flexible to change since ideas and topics are built up with clustering. Whenever we need to update the structure, we can **take a step back, see the big picture** and **change it accordingly.**
		  
	- Its workflow **separates interdependent tasks clearly**. When we focus on one task such as changing words, we do not need to worry about the outlines at the same time since they have been written down in previous task.
		  
	- It **keeps track of all *self-evidence* in written form and in public,** including all of our decisions and mistakes. We can **gain insights** through **its interconnections.** In this way, the workflow provides you with **instant feedback** through interconnected writing tasks.  
		  
	- It **gets things done** by writing down all the unfinished tasks and lingering thoughts. Thus we can trust that they will not be lost. In this way we push small stuff out of our short-term memory. 
		  
	- It **standardizes the format and storage** of both **literature** and **thoughts**. This standardization allows more automation in note-taking. This restriction **reduces the number of decisions** required from us, which improve our *productivity*. 


### Get the Gist and Keep an Open Mind

- The benefits of **note-taking** include the followings:
	- An important reading and learning skill is to **get the gist,** i.e to distinguish *relevancy* from *less relevancy*. To ***extract the gist*** of material from the other *supporting details* is the main purpose behind developing permanent notes from fleeting notes and literature notes.   	
	  
	- The original texts serve **the *agenda* of the author in a specific *context***. They are part of other's theory, support other's argument, and come from other's perspective. They also use languages that we would not use. **Rewriting** what we read in our own language helps to **reframe** it with our own perspective and to **embed** it within our own context in the slip-box. 
	  
	   *Mere copying quotes* almost always strip their meaning out of the context. This is a common beginner mistake, which can only lead to a *patchwork of ideas*, but never a coherent thought.
	   
	- It correct ***confirmation bias***, [^3] esp. when we are forced to write down arguments that contradict our own theory. Also we need to ***reflect*** as much on what is *not mentioned* as what is *mentioned.*
	  
	- It **opens our mind** [^3] by presenting materials that both for and against our own arguments in front of us.
	  
	- It force us to be **selective in reading and note-taking.** What we read should connect to existing notes and thoughts and also should open to new connections.

### Critical Thinking and Self-Evidence

- Some suggestions on using *Zettelkasten method* to boost **critical thinking**:
	- From the above perspective, when we use Zettelkasten, we should think about what does it mean **to other line of thoughts** and write it down in permanent note. This would bridge seemingly unrelated ideas that are not in original context.
		  
	- A common way to include ideas in slip-box is to make a remark on **the reason of importance to our own thoughts**. *"Why is this important to me?"*
		  
	- When writing literature notes, ask question: 
			- *"Is this convincing?"*
			- *"What methods do they use?"* 
			- *"Which of the references are familiar?"*
			  
	- When moving from literature note to permanent note, write down in permanent note the relevance of the literature to our thoughts and write down in another note the details of our thoughts. 
		  	
	- When adding permanent notes into the slip-box, ask questions [^1]
			- *"What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box?"*
			- *"Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?"*
		
	- The author also provided several suggestions that boost the ability of **critical thinking** [^3] in **reading**:
		- Good readers spot limitation of the text and see what is **not mentioned**. They read text **with question in mind** and try to **relate** to existing approaches. 
		  
		- It is critical to interpret text within **a bigger frame or argument**. We should *go beyond* what is written, *reframe* it and consider what is means to *another questions*.
		  
		- To examine an argument, we **look at it with a distance.** Do not let the argument itself occupy our mental resources, which is necessary for  closely evaluation of the argument.  
		  
		- Zettelkasten promotes a form of **thinking within the medium of writing** as well as **having a dialogue to existing notes**. By writing it down, we can release our mental resources and to scrutinize an argument with a distance.
		   
		- Real thinking requires **externalization**. In psychology, there is a term called **external scaffolding.**
		  
		- Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to **understand the wider meaning** of something.

### Long-term Memory

- Zettelkasten method would boost our **long-term memory.**
	- **Elaboration** instead of copying would help to understand the material, thus help to remember it.
		  
	- The external memory system allows us to release short-term memory in brain and **forget** about the details. **The power of forgetting** is to **grasp the gist** of the information without being distracted by detailed memories.
		  
	- The **interconnected** and facts would serve as **reciprocal reminders/cues** to each other. This achieves the goal of **learning** which is to connect pieces of information into many *contexts*.
	  
- *Learning would be not so much about saving information but to **connect pieces of information into meaningful contexts*** to **avoid the forgetting**. [^6] 	
  
- Our own mental models and the slip box should be co-evolving. 

### Comparison and Feedback Loops

- Slip box has a built-in feature that allow us to build **feedback loops**. Every time a new note is written, we are going over the entire workflow. It pushes us to find ways to **confront ourselves with our errors, mistakes and misunderstandings.** This helps to develop our habit of critical thinking. [^3]

- ***Elaborating on the differences and similarities of notes*** instead of *sorting them by topic* not only facilitates **learning**, but facilitates the ability to *categorize and create sensible classifications*.

- The benefits of **note comparison**:
	- Comparing notes also helps us to **detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions** – important facilitators for insight. 
	  
	- Comparing notes with similar concepts and thoughts would help us to **spot the crucial factor that differentiate them**. The clarification of differences in the use of words and concepts is a major part of every serious academic work
	  
	- Regularly review and compare old notes serve as a re-examination of the information we acquired. It deepen our understanding on the matter. [^3] 
	  
	- To facilitate comparison, we should keep our notes in one place. 
	  
	- Using slip-box, we can overcome the ***"feature-positive effect"***: our tendency to overstate the importance of *recently acquired knowledge (mentally easily available)* and to confuse it with *the most relevant one*. 
	  
	- The Slip box is, above all, **a tool for enforcing distinctions, decisions and making differences visible**. 

### Atomic Structure and Productivity Measure

- Although the ***productivity*** of academic writing and research cannot be directly measure as the operational works [^2], we can still **decompose** our tasks into **manageable and measurable steps**. 
	  
	- With the *atomic note structure* of Zettelkasten, we can **measure our daily productivity by the number of notes written.**
	  
	- The suggestion is to **take 3 notes per day** [^4]. 
	   
	- As the atomic notes *accumulate* in the slip-box, **the compound effect** [^4] will take place and the slip box will become more powerful: More notes mean more possible *connections*, more ideas, **more *synergy* between different projects and therefore a much higher degree of productivity.** [^5]
	  
- Atomic structure provide **flexibility** in writing and research which allows us to rearrange the ordering and selection of the set of relevant information.

## Recommended Notes

- Refer to [[How to Take Smart Note Book Summary]] for book summary

- Check on suggestions to counter confirmation bias in 
	- identifying the **flow of ideas** in [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 4]]; 
	- Raising **effective questions** in [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 3]];  
	- Understanding deeply, overcoming bias, see **what is there and what is missing** in [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 1]].
	- Learning from **mistakes**, also considering if this is *answer to another question* and **framing the questions in different ways** in  [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 2]]


[^1]: check on exercise for self-centered research to know **what you are interested in** and **what bored you**. Instead of trying to please some imaginative judge, our interest should come out of our own mind. The importance of writing our ***self-evidence*** down while doing research is discussed in [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]] Ask question to ourselves to explore the self-evidence and our interests. 
[^2]: The GTD workflow also provides a *workflow* that manage tasks and prioritize important matters using the *"Next Action" list*. Check [[Getting Things Done Book Summary]]
[^3]: Check concept of [[Confirmation Bias]]
[^4]: This suggestion coincides with the suggestions in *Atomic Habit* which also take advantages with **the compound effect** of small incremental behavior change to develop habits. This suggestion would help to develop a new habit and to break an old one. See more in [[Atomic Habits Book Summary]]. This book also discussed how to use feedback loops to develop habits. 
 [^5]: To role of **synergy** in creative cooperation is discussed in [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Chapter Summary 6]].
[^6]:  People tends to remember unfinished task better.  [[Zeigarnik Effect]]
