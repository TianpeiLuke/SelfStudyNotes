> [!Abstract]  
> Engineers must make decisions regarding the distribution of expensive resources in a manner that will be economically beneficial. This problem can be realistically formulated and logically analyzed with optimization theory. This book shows engineers how to use optimization theory to solve complex problems. Unifies the large field of optimization with a few geometric principles. Covers functional analysis with a minimum of mathematics. Contains problems that relate to the applications in the book.
