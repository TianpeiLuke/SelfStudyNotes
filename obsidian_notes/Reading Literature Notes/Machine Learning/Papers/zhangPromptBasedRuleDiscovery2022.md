# Descriptions

## Prompt-Based Rule Discovery and Boosting for Interactive Weakly-Supervised Learning 
> [!info] 
> - **Abstract:** Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has shown promising results in addressing label scarcity on many NLP tasks, but manually designing a comprehensive, high-quality labeling rule set is tedious and difficult. We study interactive weakly-supervised learning—the problem of iteratively and automatically discovering novel labeling rules from data to improve the WSL model. Our proposed model, named PRBoost, achieves this goal via iterative prompt-based rule discovery and model boosting. It uses boosting to identify large-error instances and discovers candidate rules from them by prompting pre-trained LMs with rule templates. The candidate rules are judged by human experts, and the accepted rules are used to generate complementary weak labels and strengthen the current model. Experiments on four tasks show PRBoost outperforms state-of-the-art WSL baselines up to 7.1%, and bridges the gaps with fully supervised models.

> - **Conclusion**:  We proposed PRBOOST to iteratively discover prompt-based rules for interactive weaklysupervised learning. Through a boosting-style ensemble strategy, it iteratively evaluates model weakness to identify large-error instances for new rule proposal. From such large-error instances, its prompt-based rule discovery module leads to expressive rules that can largely improve rule coverage while being easy to annotate. The discovered rules complement the current rule set and refine the WSL model continuously. Our experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PRBOOST can largely improve WSL and narrow the gaps between WSL models and fully-supervised models.
