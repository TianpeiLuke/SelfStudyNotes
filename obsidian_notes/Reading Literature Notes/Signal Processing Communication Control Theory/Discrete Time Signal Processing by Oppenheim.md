> [!Abstract]  
> For senior/graduate-level courses in Discrete-Time Signal Processing.Discrete-Time Signal Processing, Third Edition is the definitive, authoritative text on DSP â€“ ideal for those with introductory-level knowledge of signals and systems. Written by prominent DSP pioneers, it provides thorough treatment of the fundamental theorems and properties of discrete-time linear systems, filtering, sampling, and discrete-time Fourier Analysis. By focusing on the general and universal concepts in discrete-time signal processing, it remains vital and relevant to the new challenges arising in the field.Access to the password-protected companion Website and myeBook is included with each new copy of Discrete-Time Signal Processing, Third Edition.
