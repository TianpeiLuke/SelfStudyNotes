> [!Abstract]  
> For undergraduate-level courses in Signals and Systems.This comprehensive exploration of signals and systems develops continuous-time and discrete-time concepts/methods in parallel -- highlighting the similarities and differences -- and features introductory treatments of the applications of these basic methods in such areas as filtering, communication, sampling, discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals, and feedback. Relatively self-contained, the text assumes no prior experience with system analysis, convolution, Fourier analysis, or Laplace and z-transforms.
