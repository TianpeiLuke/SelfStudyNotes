## Book Summary



- This book mainly covers the research phases in *History, Philosophy, Literature and Arts.* 

Q: What about the research in **Science, Engineering and Math (STEM)?**

- The researches in **STEM** also follow a similar phase: 
	- **from topic to question**, 
	- **from question to problem**, 
	- **from problem to sources**, and then 
	- **assembling arguments**, 
	- **writing proposals**, 
	-  **writing drafts with reviews and revisions**. 
	  
- However, the research activities in *STEM* focus on ***logical deductions**, **experiments** and **data analysis***, while researches in literature, history and arts focus on *interviews, archaeology discovery, literature reviews, art creation* etc.  
  
- The ***primary sources*** for STEM are also different. 
	- In **science and technology**, the primary sources are mainly ***experimental data/database**, **original codes**, **experiment notes** and the **environment** and **equipment** for the experiments.*
	  
	- In **math**, the primary sources are mainly *the **definitions**, **examples**, **previous proved related results** (definitions, lemmas, theorems, proofs, applications), as well as **the deduction logics** for argument}.* 
	  
- The authors mention that after initial brainstorming, we need to *stress-testing our question* using sources. 
  
- For STEM, the stress-testing procedure not only involves ***searching and reading literature*** (secondary sources) but also involves ***conducting initial data analysis and proof-of-concept experiments*** (primary sources)}. In this early phase, we should not focus on answering our questions, but instead focusing on the ***develop, refine and expand our questions***.  
  
- In *the primary source **engagement*** phase, the authors discussed about how to *use/expand **keyword search*** on digital databases, and how to **refine our questions** based on search results.  The author also mentions that we need to envision the best primary sources to expand our search. 
  
  Both these methods can be used in STEM but not sufficient. For STEM, the primary sources are collected by the researchers themselves first hand through **experiments** and **data analysis**. Searching literature is still needed but would not be enough. 

- The *experiment and data collection phase* is the most **resource-consuming** phase of the research. The authors suggest to ***take notes*** during *Cereal Box Challenge* [[Where Research Begins Exercise 08 Treat Your Primary Source Like a Cereal Box]]. 

- ***Envisioning the primary sources** means to imagine **the ideal experiment** and/or **ideal database** that related to the research.* This is a useful advice.
