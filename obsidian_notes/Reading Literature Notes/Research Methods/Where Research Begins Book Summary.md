## Book Summary

- In this book, the authors proposed the ***Self-Centered Research*** process, an **inside-out self-motivated** research **practice, ethic and a state of mind**. It discuss, at *the beginning phase of research*, how the research problem is *identified, refined and evaluated*, through ***inward-focus first*** and ***outward-focus later** methodology.* 

- This book focus on ***raising the internal motivations*** of researcher *before the research process started*, and in the process to gain **self-awareness, self-trust and affirmation on the research problem as well as the direction of research** on their own. It stress the importance of ***"finding your center"*** [^1]  -- your **Problem**, i.e. the matters that really motivates **you** to start the research.  It focus on the question of *"Why?"*

- When you find your *center*, you gain a **superpower**: *the ability to **discern when your Problem itself is changing**, or perhaps **when new problems are starting to take shape in your mind.*** 

- By using ***"introversion first, extroversion second"** approach*, the authors help the early researchers to ***avoid** being **distracted** by perspectives, ideas, suggestions from **others** (authorities, mentors, colleagues)} in research communities*, as well as to *avoid **the judgmental thoughts** from **their own mind**, which could hurt the inner exploration processing at early stage of research.* 

- This book has a favor of using **psychological treatment** (e.g. EEG reading) to examine the researcher's own *interest/boredom* *during various phases of research.*

- The **key** messages to early researchers:
	- *Be **vulnerable***
	- ***Listening to yourself***
	- ***Writing things down***

- This book is divided into *two stages*:
	1. ***inward stage:*** the *goal* of this stage is the ***raise the self-awareness*** of the researcher ourselves on our motivations and values. This way to make sure we are confident on our direction and priorities. This stage is also the stage we *accumulate knowledge, source materials and raise our arguments*.  
	   
	   In this stage, 
		- we transform **from *topics* into *questions:*** including 
			- **question brainstorming**, [[Where Research Begins Exercise 01 Search Yourself]]
			- **interest self-observation**, [[Where Research Begins Exercise 01 Search Yourself]]
			- **boredom self-observation**, [[Where Research Begins Exercise 02 Let Boredom Be Your Guide]]  
			- **question narrow-down and specification**.[[Where Research Begins Exercise 04 Run a Diagnostic Test on Your Questions]]
			  
		- **from *questions* into *problems:*** including 
			- **question linguistic check**, [[Where Research Begins Exercise 04 Run a Diagnostic Test on Your Questions]]
			- **question source check**, **question expansion**, [[Where Research Begins Exercise 05 Use Primary Sources to Educate Your Questions]]
			- **assumption uncover and modification**,  [[Where Research Begins Exercise 06 Make Your Assumptions Visible]]
			- **problem identification**. [[Where Research Begins Exercise 07 Identify the Problem That Connects Your Questions]]
			  
		- we 
			- **engage sources** [[Where Research Begins Exercise 08 Treat Your Primary Source Like a Cereal Box]], [[Where Research Begins Exercise 09 Envision Your Primary Sources]]
			- and **assemble our arguments**. [[Where Research Begins Exercise 10 Connect the Dots Using Your Sources]]
		  
		- finally, we 
			- **plan** our project [[Where Research Begins Exercise 11 Decision Matrix]] and 
			- **write** our **research proposal**. [[Where Research Begins Exercise 12 Prepare a Formal Research Proposal]]
			  
	2. ***outward stage:*** the *goal* of this stage is to ***raise awareness** on the **external ideas and perspectives** in your **field** and your **Problem Collectives***, and to make most out of this ***relationship***.[^2]
	   
		- Part 2 moves your research journey into a *broader and deeper **engagement*** with other people’s ideas. 
		  
		- This stage focus on **engaging with external world** and their perspectives, ideas, esp. with your **field** and your **Problem Collectives.** 
			[[Where Research Begins Exercise 13 Change One Variable]]
			[[Where Research Begins Exercise 14 Before and After]]
			[[Where Research Begins Exercise 15 Map Out Your Collective]]
		  
		- We are also going to revise our *draft* based on their **feedback** for multiple rounds. 
			[[Where Research Begins Exercise 16 Find and Replace All Insider Language]]
			[[Where Research Begins Exercise 17 Start Your Own What’s Your Problem Bookstore]]
			[[Where Research Begins Exercise 19 Rewrite for Your Field]]
			[[Where Research Begins Exercise 20 Create Draft 0]]
			[[Where Research Begins Exercise 21 Move from 0 to 1]]
		  
		- The *goal* of outward stage is to **build connections** with our fellow researchers and to **publish** work that *matters not only to ourselves but also to the **community** we belonged to*. 
	   
- This book also deals with *how to **consume sources** (**primary** sources, **secondary** sources).* This is an important activity in research. The main *goal* is to *understand the problem*, including **our own problem** and **the other people's problem.**  
  
  The key is to *distinguish a specific **case of problem** vs. the **problem** itself.*  
  [[Where Research Begins Exercise 13 Change One Variable]]

- In *the primary source **engagement*** phase, the authors discussed about how to *use/expand **keyword search*** on digital databases, and how to **refine our questions** based on search results.  The author also mentions that we need to envision the best primary sources to expand our search.
