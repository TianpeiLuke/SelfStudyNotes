## Book Chapter Summary

- This books covers several phases of early research:
1. **Question Brainstorming with Self-Observation**:[^1] at this earliest phase, the task is to **generate questions relevant to you**, *from the best of your knowledge*.

	- While scanning through entities under a topic, ask yourself  *"Why does that interest you?" or "Why i do not care about it?"*  **Take notes** [^2] on questions generated and **flag** those with unconsciously effect (interest/boredom) on you. 
	  
	- The point is being **honest**, **self-observing** but not **not be judgmental**. 
	  
	- Your questions are for yourself. They are meant to be ***unpolished***. Use normal worlds, not jargon. *You are not meant to impress anyone.*
	  
	- Your questions need to be ***specific and concrete***, ***not vague**, not abstracting***. 
	  
2. **Question Refinement**:[^3] In this step we **improve the questions** you have already generated. There are two ways for stress-testing your questions:
  
	- Focus on **language**: By the end of this process, your questions should meet these criteria:
		- **clear**, **precise**, and **jargon-free**. 
		- rooted in **verifiable and falsifiable data**. Your research questions should have *integrity*. This means that they should be inspired by *fact*, rather than by *speculation, prejudice, or opinion*. 
		- **indifferent to the outcome.** A research question ***should not presume a certain answer***. If yours does, rewrite it to *eliminate that **presumption***.
		- clear about the **subject**. Be as specific as you can be about the *who* in your question.
		- **raw** and **undisciplined**. At least for now.
		  
	- Focus on **sources**. Rather than trying to use primary sources to start answering the questions you’ve come up with, we want you to use them to *develop, refine, and expand those questions*. 
		- ***Refine** and **Expand** your keyword* used for searching the primary sources. Pay close attentions to new keywords in *titles, abstract, index, introduction, conclusion*. Keep track of all keywords, the primary sources and searches found during the process. 
		  
		- Reveal ***the hidden assumption*** behind these questions. Also for assumptions that are bias, do not discard them directly; instead modify them and improve them. 
		  
		  Keep a note on all of assumptions discovered and then treat them accordingly based on your evaluation and your intent. 
		  
		  During this categorization process, write down your thoughts and reasons for the categorization.
		  
3. **Problem Identification**: 
	- In particular, we need to ***generalize** from previous questions to higher level.* Also we need to **group** these questions and to identify **the shared concerns** among these questions.
	  
	- Note that it is not time to answer these questions. 
	  
	- Q: *How do I know when I’ve truly discovered my Problem?* 
	  A problem is never a fleeting thing. Rather, it is something that is **sustained** and **enduring**.
	  
4. **Primary Source Engagement**: We need to *identify, filter and refine* your **list of primary sources** based on the identified problems. *On the other hand*, we also need to **milk our sources** to generate ***a genre of new related questions*** to the same problem. We will connect to different projects and then connect with different sources.
  
	- You need to *distinguish primary and secondary sources.* 
	  
	  **Primary Sources** are the ***evidence*** that you use to *develop and test claims*, *hypotheses*, and *theories about reality*. 

	- Note that a source’s **type** (primary or secondary) is determined solely by ***its relationship with the questions** you are trying to answer*, and ***the problem** you are trying to solve.* A source is never inherently primary or secondary.
	  
	- How you **treat this source** will lead you down either *a narrow path or a broad avenue of potential research questions.* 
	  
	- We can 
		- *jump to obvious candidates:* direct questions related to the source or the elements of the source; or
		- think about ***different projects** that might include this source;*
		- think about ***other primary sources.***
		  
	- We can name ***the genre** of questions* and considering them connected to an underlying problem. 
	  
	- You need to deep dive and discover the full potential of these primary sources.  This helps you to look beyond obvious questions and to arrive at something original.
	  
	- ***Envision** imaginative primary sources* that best answer your question. Search for it.
	  
	- You need to **pinpoint these sources** *to your problem*; determine if they are *relevant, redundant, reliable*. 
	  
5. **Argument Construction**: We need to make proper argument from these sources. Before, we need to ***prepare enough primary sources** to make a good argument.* [^4][^5] In particular, we need to 
	- Find the dots (primary sources). 
	- Figure out which dots *belong to your picture*, and which dots belong to some other picture. 
	- Figure out which dots are not dots at all. *Not all materials can be used as sources.* 
	- *Do all of the above in real time.* **Do not expect linear progression.**
	- Determine *when you have enough.*
	  
6. **Research Project Design and Initial Proposal Drafting**: We need to write a *research project proposal before our research is ready.* 
	- Note that ***we cannot fully prepared to start a research*** but we should get started. [[Bias for Action]]
	  
	- This research project proposal is ***for ourselves only*** and it provides a written record for our **envisioning** at the *raw, premature state*. [[Where Research Begins Exercise 12 Prepare a Formal Research Proposal]]
	  
	- We can show it to our mentors and ask for advises. Then we can revise them accordingly. 
	  
7. **Problem Collective Identification**: After we have finished our research project design and proposal, we need to ***move beyond ourselves** and to **translate** our work to **external audiences**.* Before we start the translation and revision of our draft, we need to know **who our audiences are.** This part address the tasks of *identifying our main audience,* those who shared the same interest as we do on the problem. These people are called ***Problem Collectives*** in this book. 
   
	- The *main* discussion point in this chapter is to still ***discovery the essence (non-negotiable part) of our own problem*** by removing the redundant components that may not interest us.  This way we also ***expand our problem** to a broader scope.*
	  
	  This way makes us easier to discover people who *interest in similar problems* as we did in a *broader scope.*
	  
	- Two approaches are introduced to expand our problem scope:
		- [[Where Research Begins Exercise 13 Change One Variable]]: decompose our problem into a set of variables, and make a variation of our problem with changing one variable. This allows us to understand the part of our problem that is non-negotiable, which is the key to our problem. It also allows us to expand our search by changing the other negotiable part of our problem. 
		  
		- [[Where Research Begins Exercise 14 Before and After]]: allows us to envision our work be part of a flow of works, with predecessors and successors's work. Understand the flow of ideas before us and after us helps us to understand our problem in a development perspective.
		  
	- This chapter also provides a practice of ***expanding the searching scope** of Problem Collective* using ***secondary sources*** such as publications. 
	  
	- *The most important observation* in this chapter is to understand that ***not all of variables of our problem is non-negotiable***. We can always change some part of our problem without altering our interest on them. 
	  
	- The key to *identify a member of Problem Collective* is to *understand if **their problems are also your problem***, *up to some change of variable practice*, and *if their works have **impact** on you*.
	  
	- The stage of ***Problem Collective identification*** may be intertwined with ***the Problem Identification** stage as well as ***the Source Engagement** stage*.
	  
8. **Rewriting for Problem Collective**: After we identify the Problem Collective, we need to **rewrite** our proposal *for our Problem Collective.*
   
	- The main work in this part is to **identify and remove field's jargons**.  Our familiar concepts and keywords may not be understood by outsiders, who may be in our Problem Collective.
	  
	- These jargons include *terms, individual, organization, nouns, adjectives/adverbs, acronyms, abbreviations etc*.
	  
	- The rewriting practice has a lot of benefits: 
		- It helps us to *keep the problem **front and center***. By focusing on the *essence* problem, It should drive the flow of your prose, the structure of your argument, and the words you use.
		  
		- It helps us to ***step out of our Field’s echo chamber***. By removing field's code words, we would help the outsiders to understand our questions and, more importantly, to **identify us as a part of the same Problem Collective**.
		  
		- The early phases of research benefit from *slowing down* and *decompressing language*.
		  
	- We are likely going to have to *write for your Collective in ways that your Field doesn’t demand of you*.[^6]
	  
	- We need to be aware that ***our Problem Collectives may not share the same solution as us.*** 
	  
9. **Field Navigation and Literature Reviews**: We are assigned to our **Field**, which is organized according to **Topics**. This part deals with why should we ***navigate** outside our own Problem Collectives into our Field* and how should we do that ***without losing our problem.***
	- Our main *goal* is to ***identify the different Problem Collectives within our Field.*** In this way, we can 
		- understand better *how our Field works*,
		- understand *how to make our Field work for you*. 
		  
		More importantly, we need to learn how to navigate our field without losing sightly of our own Problems.
		
	- A major **mindset shift** in this chapter is to ***view Field not as a collection of subfields but rather an assortment of Problem Collectives with different problems and interests.***
	  
	- People in our Field may not write for us, but *their own Problem Collectives.* 
	  
	- *Why should we navigate in our Field?*
		- *Our Collective helps us to get to ourselves, and our **Field** helps us to **outgrow ourselves**.*
		  
		- In order to *let our Field to understand our problem*, we need to ***first* understand *their* problems**.[^7]
		  
	- This chapter mainly deals with ***literature reviews*** and reimagines how we should do it. 
		- The authors stress that what matters is not for you to *"**fill in gap**" but to demonstrate to the other audience **what is your ideas**, and how your ideas are going **to help your audience with their ideas**.*
		  
		- When doing literature reviews, we take this opportunities to [^8]
			- **listen** to these other collectives,
			- **acknowledge** *how* members of other collectives bring their own agendas and *values to bear on your topic*,
			- consider their findings **in the light of *their Problems (not yours)***.
			  
	- *"Our job in navigating your Field is to **bring together scholars** (senior/junior, live/dead) into conversation with one another about a set of questions and concerns that together add up to a **survey** of the most compelling and important research **on our Problem**."*
	  
	- This chapter also provides some reminders on how to evaluate sources:
		- Be **skeptical**. Just because something was published in a peer-reviewed journal or a book doesn’t mean it's watertight.
		  
		- Be **fair**. Represent every source's ***merits** and **shortcomings** accurately*.
		  
		- **Focus on the author's concerns, not your own.** Be aware of the significance of merits and shortcomings ***to the author's main goal***. 
		  
		- **Separate people from their problems.**[^9] We are evaluting the ideas not the people who proposed them.
		  
	- Finally, this chapter deals with an exercise [[Where Research Begins Exercise 17 Start Your Own What’s Your Problem Bookstore]]. While reading papers outsider your scope, and not for your Problem, ***learn to identify what is their problem**  and to **group their problems together** accordingly*. 
	  
10. **Rewriting for Field**: Repeat the same process *but for people who may not be interested in your Problem.* 
	- make sure that what you’ve written is ***comprehensible** for both **insiders** and **outsiders***.
	  
	- how to write so that your Problem may be ***useful for your audience's Problem as well.***
	  
	- you may be able to ***change their mind and make them your Problem Collective.***
	  
11. **Assembling into Draft**: Finally, we need to ***organize** all collected written **"self-evidences"** at every phase of early research and start writing our **first formal draft.***[^10]  This chapter is a *review* of all previous written works.
    
	- **Writing** in this phase 
		- brings all of the writing you have already done **together into one place**,[^10] and 
		- begin that process of ***sifting**, **selecting**, **structuring**, and **clarifying.***
		  
	- The key is to *write, review and revise continuously until it is ready for public.*

[^3]: This is the part where we move **from questions to problems**. At this step, we use *sources* to **identify the problem** by understanding **internal connections between questions.** We also learn how to use our Problem to *generate new and better questions.*
[^4]: Be aware of the ***ethical issues*** on how to use the source materials. Be *honest* for what you see and what you don't see. Not forcing a story. Represent the source accurately.  
[^5]: Source has its own **agency** so treat them with ***critical mindset***. Even if the sources contain flaws, you can still use them in question-generation process to clarify your assumptions and problems. See suggestions in [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 2]]
[^6]: They may not be impressed by the same topics as our Field. Also we need to note that our Problem Collectives *may not have same default inhibitions.*
