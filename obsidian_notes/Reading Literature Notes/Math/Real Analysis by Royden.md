> [!Abstract]  
> Real Analysis, 4th Edition covers the basic material that every graduate student should know in the classical theory of functions of a real variable, measure and integration theory, and some of the more important and elementary topics in general topology and normed linear space theory. It assumes a general background in undergraduate mathematics and familiarity with the material covered in an undergraduate course on the fundamental concepts of analysis. Patrick Fitzpatrick of the University of Maryland - College Park spearheaded this revision of Halsey Royden's classic text.This title is part of the Pearson Modern Classics series. Pearson Modern Classics are acclaimed titles at a value price.
