## Book Summary

>[!summary]
>This book explores how our *beliefs* about intelligence, talent, and abilities shape our success in life. 
>
>The book introduces the concept of **fixed mindset** vs. **growth mindset** and explains how adopting a growth mindset can lead to greater achievement, resilience, and personal development.

>[!info]
>_Mindset_ teaches that intelligence and talent are not fixed traits—they can be cultivated with **effort, learning, and resilience**. By adopting a growth mindset, individuals can achieve greater success in school, work, relationships, and beyond.


## Key Takeaways

### The Two Mindsets: **Fixed** vs. **Growth**

> [!info]
> Dweck identifies two core ways people view their abilities and intelligence:
> 
> - **Fixed Mindset**
>     - Believes *intelligence*, *talent*, and *abilities* are **static**—you either have them or you don’t.
>     - *Avoids challenges* for fear of failure.
>     - Views *effort* as pointless if you're "not naturally good" at something.
>     - Ignores constructive feedback and feels threatened by others' success.
>     - Example: 
> 	    - A student who avoids difficult subjects because they believe they're "not good at math."
> - **Growth Mindset**
>     - Believes *intelligence* and *abilities* **can be developed** through *effort*, *learning*, and *persistence*.
> 	    - [[Grit Book Summary]]
>     - *Embraces challenges* as opportunities to grow.
>     - Sees *effort* as the *path to mastery*.
>     - Welcomes feedback and *learns from failures*.
> 	    - [[The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking Suggestion 2]]
>     - Example: 
> 	    - An athlete who continuously practices to improve, despite setbacks.

### Impact of Mindsets

>[!info] 
> Dweck applies the mindset concept to various fields:
> 
> - **Education:**
>     - Students with a growth mindset achieve more because they see challenges as learning opportunities.
>     - Praising **effort** ("You worked really hard") rather than **ability** ("You're so smart") fosters a growth mindset.
> - **Business & Leadership:**
>     - Growth-oriented leaders encourage *innovation*, *learning from failure*, and *resilience*.
>     - Fixed-mindset leaders fear challenges and avoid risks, stifling company growth.
>     - [[Developing the Leader Within You 2.0 Book Summary]]
> - **Relationships:**
>     - Fixed mindset: Believes relationships should be "meant to be" and avoids conflict.
>     - Growth mindset: Sees relationships as *evolving* through *communication* and *effort*.
>     - [[Tips for Effective Communication]]
> - **Sports & Performance:**
>     - Athletes with a growth mindset improve more because they believe in effort and perseverance.
>     - Example: 
> 	    - Michael Jordan, who was cut from his high school basketball team but used failure as motivation.

### Development of Growth Mindset

>[!info]
> Dweck provides practical strategies to shift toward a growth mindset:
> 
> - **Recognize your mindset:** 
> 	- Be aware of when you're thinking in a fixed way.
> - **Reframe challenges:** 
> 	- View obstacles as opportunities to learn.
> - **Embrace failure:** 
> 	- See mistakes as part of the learning process.
> - **Cultivate effort:** 
> 	- Focus on progress and persistence rather than perfection.
> - **Use constructive feedback:**

## Quote

>[!quote]
>For thirty years, my research has shown that *the view you adopt for yourself* profoundly affects the way you lead your life. It can determine whether you become the person you want to be and whether you accomplish the things you value.
>
>pp 6

>[!quote]
>Believing that *your qualities are carved in stone*—the **fixed mindset**—creates an urgency to *prove yourself* over and over. If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character—well, then you’d better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn’t do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.
>
>...
>There’s another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand you’re dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and others that you have a royal flush when you’re secretly worried it’s a pair of tens. In this mindset, the hand you’re dealt is just the starting point for development. This **growth mindset** is based on the belief that *your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts, your strategies, and help from others.* Although people may differ in every which way—in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone can change and grow through application and experience.

>[!info]
>You can see how the belief that cherished qualities can be developed creates a *passion for learning*. Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The *passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well,* is the *hallmark of the growth mindset*. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.

>*Fixed-mindset leaders*, like fixed-mindset people in general, live in a world where some people are superior and some are inferior. They must *repeatedly affirm that they are superior*, and the company is simply a platform for this.
