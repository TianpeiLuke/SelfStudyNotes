## Book Summary

- **Building A Second Brain (BASB)** is a self-improvement book by Tiago Forte. This book provides a systematic way to develop a ***personal knowledge management system (PKM)*** using digital applications. This PKM would help us to increase our memorizing capacity, to boost our productivity and to spark our creativity,  
  
- **The Second Brain** in this book is the personal knowledge management system, which is viewed as an *externalized* system for information storage and organization as well as idea generation and expression. 
  
- Besides the *information collection* and *management*, the author also emphasizes the importance of **expressing our ideas** via teaching, writing, producing and helping others.
   
- **Note-taking** [^1] plays a central role in developing the personal knowledge management system in BASB, where notes are the building blocks of the system. In the book, the author discussed the benefits of "writing it down" to "knowledge workers". [^2]

- BASB generalizes from the ideas in the book *Getting Things Done (GTD)* by David Allan. [^3]  In particular, both books stress the importance of developing an efficient **workflow in bottom-up manner** to boost productivity.  The ***GTD workflow*** is the basis of the ***PARA workflow*** in BASB. BASB's emphasis on ***actionability*** is borrowed from the *"Next Action Principle"* of GTD.

- The main contribution of this book is the proposal of **CODE** as an end-to-end workflow to develop the Second Brain. CODE consists of four steps: **Capture**, **Organize,** **Distill** and **Express**. In particular, 
    
	- **Capture**: Similar to the *Capture* stage in original GTD, in this stage, the **goal** is to gather information that are of interest to us. The key term is ***"resonate"*** as we cannot include all information in our knowledge system due to its vast volume. ***Being selective*** in our capturing process is critical to clear the clutter and reduce the information need to be organized. In order to understand what resonates with us, we need to keep our *self-introspection* on. Captured information is written in *notes* which are kept in the system. [^4]
	  
	- **Organize**: This stage focus on the *actionability*. Specifically, the author proposes to organize information according to the active projects that we are working on. This follows the *"Next Action Principle"* of GTD. The proposed action-oriented organization system is named ***PARA*** in the book. **PARA** is the short name of ***Project***, ***Area***, ***Resource*** and ***Archive***. It is a *hierarchical* information organization, ordered according to the actionability of the information.  
	  
		- **Projects**: require ***short-term efforts*** with *definitive goal* and *deadline*. Projects contain immediate actionable items and their associated information. Projects, by definition, can be completed in a *finite* time period. 
		  
		- **Areas**: define ***long-term responsibilities*** that need to manage over time. *Areas*, or *Areas of Responsibility* are associated with the roles we played in our life. Usually an area requires continual maintenance and development without a clear deadline. In personal development, area represents a higher level of commitment with a long term end-goal. Thus the definition and maintenance of area needs *principles* and *standards* developed in ***top-down manner***. It can also help us to identify our own ***Circle of Influence***. [^5]
		  
		-  **Resources**: are topics or interests that are *not immediately actionable* but *may be* useful in future. [^6] Resources include non-actionable items as well as reference materials. These materials will be reserved for possible future projects. It is critical to use a *reference management system* to keep this part of data. [^7]

		- **Archives**: keep records of the inactive items from previous three categories. *Completed projects* will be saved as a whole in archive together with out-dated requests etc. According to the author, *"completed projects are the oxygen of your second brain."*   
		  
		We can see that Projects are most actionable, while Archives remain inactive unless they are needed. Resources may be actionable depending on the situation. Areas need long term vision and thus are less immediately actionable than Projects. 
		
	- **Distill**: This stage is *unique* in BASB compared to GTD. In this stage, the author emphasize the ***discoverability*** of our notes in system. *Discover-ability* defines *"how easy it is to discover what they contain and access the specific points that are most immediately useful."*  Following the need to improve discoverability, the author proposed the ***Progressive Summarization*** technique that *"distill notes down to their most important points."*  The goal of distillation is to spot the *patterns and connections* from the essence of the information. [^8] It is critical since we do not have time to read long notes during the review.  
	  
	- **Express**: This stage stress the importance of *transforming information into knowledge* by *expressing* ourselves to others. [^9] It is our nature to share what we know and to create new ideas, to produce new products, to change our surroundings. ***"Information becomes knowledge only when we use it."***  In this stage, we convert ourselves from consumers to producers.  
	  
	  
-  This book contains three parts:
	- Part I is the **foundation** of the book. It mainly provides an overview of the book including the motivation, background, as well as the main ideas. In this part, the author introduces the concept of *Second Brain*, as well as *the CODE workflow* that develops the Second Brain. [[Building a Second Brain Chapter Summary 1]]
	  
	- Part II focuses on **the four steps in the CODE workflow**. Each chapter in this part discusses the detailed implementation in one specific step (*Capture, Organize, Distill and Express*). This part is mainly about "how to". [[Building a Second Brain Chapter Summary 2]]
	  
	- Part III discusses the **principles** and **habits** that would boost creativity and productivity using the Second Brain. [[Building a Second Brain Chapter Summary 3]] 
	  
	  In particular, the author discusses:
		- **The Art of Creative Execution**: This part explains the progress of creativity and how the Second Brain could spark creativity and nurture the progressive innovations. [^10] In particular, it allows us
			- to balance divergence and convergence in thinking, 
			- to build momentum via accumulation over time
			- to guide us where to start without fearing of interruption
			- to limit our scope and to make our idea concrete  [^11]
			  
		- **The Essential Habit of Digital Organizers**: Developing and maintaining habits of note-taking is essential for BASB. This chapter is about how to use tools and systems to ***develop a good habit*** of productivity. [^12] In particular, it is via *Project checklist*, *Weekly/Monthly Review* and *Noticing Habits*. [^13]
		  
		- **The Path of Self-Expression**: This chapter discuss the various ***paradigm shifts*** including from *scarcity mindset* to *abundance mindset* [^14], from consumer to producer. The author also discusses how to overcome the fear of uncertainty and the lack of confidence. The author also encourage the reader to express themselves to external world, seeking external audience. [^15]  It ends with encouragement to the reader to make a shift in mindset.

[^1]: The idea of externalization of processing in systems of notes is the key behind the development of Zettelkasten method discussed in [[How to Take Smart Note Book Summary]]. We can check on webpage.

[^2]: Similar opinions can be seen in the book [[How to Take Smart Note Book Summary]] as well as [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]] and thus BASB can be used as a companion book when reading the above two books. 

[^3]: *Building A Second Brain (BASB)* can be seen as an extension of *the GTD principles* for digital applications. In particular, it extends the *"Next Action Principle"* to the *PARA system*. See details of GTD in  [[Getting Things Done Book Summary]]

[^4]: The emphasis of only capturing information that *"resonates"* with us is also the key idea behind *self-centered researcher* in [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]]. We can use the exercise in  [[Where Research Begins Exercise 01 Search Yourself]] and [[Where Research Begins Exercise 02 Let Boredom Be Your Guide]] to apply self-introspection to detect useful information. *Being selective* in note-taking is also an important suggestion in [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 2]].

[^5]: The definition Area of Responsibility is high level. It defines *"an area of activity with a standard to be maintained over time."* It is associated with ***personal vision, personal leadership*** instead of ***personal management*** since this standard is essentially our *principles of life*. For a top-down approach of productivity improvement, check on   [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 0 Book Summary]]. In particular, check on [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 2 Vision Leadership Management]] for *the Habit of Proactivity* and *the Habit of Begin with End in Mind*. We can also find useful concepts including the definition of *Circle of Influence* and *personal mission statement* which encodes our *roles* and *responsibilities* as well as their *associated principles*.

[^6]: In GTD, if an item is not immediately actionable, it will be put in a *"Maybe/Sometimes"* folder for future review. This folder is the *Resource* folder in PARA. 

[^7]: Use Reference management system would help us to keep all relevant information together. Use as few systems as possible to avoid forgetting where to find the information in future. See [[How to Take Smart Note Workflow]] for similar suggestion. 

[^8]: Progressive summarization can be seen in the categorization of fleeting notes, literature notes and permanent notes in Zettelkasten. Each latter one is the summarization and generalization of the former one. See [[How to Take Smart Note Workflow]]. It also shows that how Zettelkasten connects different permanent notes after distillation of raw notes.

[^9]: *"Introversion First, Extroversion Second"* is the key message for the book *Where Research Begins*. See [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]]. This is the same as the *Express* stage in CODE. 

[^10]: The benefits of note-taking with summarization and connection to creativity has been discussed in [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 3]]. It also resonates with the concept of "slow hunch" by Steven Johnson in *Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation*

[^11]: This suggestion is critical during the question raising phase of research. [[Where Research Begins Book Chapter Summary]]

[^12]: This chapter borrow ideas from *Atomic Habits* from James Clear. Check on  [[Atomic Habits Book Summary]].

[^13]: Weakly/Monthly Review was proposed by GTD in  [[Getting Things Done Book Summary]]

[^14]: The abundance mindset is also associated with *the Habit of Thinking Win/Win*.  [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 4 Win-Win]]. Similarly  paradigm shift is the key message for many self-help books including [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 0 Book Summary]],  [[Atomic Habits Book Summary]] and [[How to Take Smart Note Book Summary]], [[Scarcity Brain Book Summary]]

[^15]: The suggestion of sharing ideas to others coincides with suggestions in both  [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 3]] and [[Where Research Begins Book Chapter Summary]]
