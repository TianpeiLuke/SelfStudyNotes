## Chapter Summary

- **Part 4: Renewal.** This part deals with the *continual **balanced** development of ourselves and our relationship in an **ever-changing interdependent environment***. The author in this part inspired the readers to view themselves in the middle of process. The ***renewal process** is an **upward spiral** that involves **learning**, **commitment** and **doing***. All habits (1-6), principles and skills we have learned so far need to be maintained and practiced *regularly and consistently*. [^1]
  
- The ultimate *goal* of renewal is to always prepare ourselves in upcoming challenges in life.
  
	- **Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw -- Principles of Balanced Self-Renewal.** There are two keywords in the principle: **balanced** and **self-renewal**. On the self-renewal part, the author introduced *four dimensions of renewal*:
		- **Physical Dimension**: our body, food, exercise, rest;
		- **Spiritual Dimension**: our principles, our values, our personal missions, and our commitments;
		- **Mental Dimension:** our knowledge, our educations, skills in learning, reading, writing, planning etc;
		- **Emotional/Social Dimension:** our relationship, synergy, empathetic communications, our intrinsic security.
		
		Note that all four dimensions of self-renewal requires us to be *proactive* since they are all *Quadrant II matters*. In fact, ***the renewal process***, as the Habit 7 suggests, is Quadrant II activity -- *Sharpen the saws is not urgent but important*. Use our Habit 1 and Habit 3 to help in the planning and executing Habit 7. 
		
		Finally, the author suggests us to "show diligence in the process of renewal by *educating and obeying our conscience*". ***Conscience*** is the endowment that "*senses our congruence or disparity with correct principles and lifts us towards them.*" 
		
		- As we renew on all four dimensions in a balanced way, we will reinforce all our Habits learned by far. 
			- *Physical dimension renewal* reinforces our *personal vision (Habit 1) with proactivity*
			- *Spiritual dimension renewal* reinforces our *personal leadership (Habit 2)* with improved imagination, conscience to deeply understand our principles and values.
			- *Mental dimension renewal* reinforces our *personal management (Habit 3)* via *Quadrant II focus and prioritization*.
			- *Emotional/Social dimension renewal* reinforces our *interpersonal leadership (Habit 4)* and *empathetic communications (Habit 5)* and then, based on the foundation of Habit 1-3 on *Private Victory*, it provides the source of intrinsic security that we need to *Sharpen the Saw (Habit 7)*.
			- In the process of ***balanced renewal***, we would reach to *Synergy (Habit 6)*.
		  
		In this final principle, *the Principle of Balanced Self-renewal*, we revisit all the Habits and Principles we have learned so far and we realized that they are interconnected and are reinforcing each other. 
		
		***The Synergy of Seven Habits*** is also the ultimate ideal destination for the readers after finishing reading the book. The process of balanced renewal is thus critical for reader to master all seven principles and seven habits together. 

- **Inside-Out Again** 
  "*Becoming a **Transition Person***" is the last message of this book. It is an inspiring message from author to break the "scripts" from past generations to the future. "***Rescripting yourself*** and ***scripting** the others*."




  [^1]: To maintain the renewal process, one need to develop a set of long term habits in each of four dimensions (physical, mental, spiritual, emotional/social). See [[Atomic Habits Book Summary]] for methods of habit developments.
