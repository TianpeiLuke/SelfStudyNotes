## Chapter Summary

- **Habit 4: Think Win/Win -- Principles of Interpersonal Leadership.** This chapter deals with people's different mindsets under different environment: *Win/Loss*; *Loss/Win*; *Loss/Win*; *Lose/Lose*; *Win*, and ***Win/Win (or No Deal)***
	    
	The first three mindsets mainly deal with ***competitive environments**, with **limited resources*** and *opposite goals* (***scarcity mindset***). The author, however, stressed that maintaining a competitive mindset would *narrow our perspective* and *cost people's trust towards us*, which consequently hurt our relationship with others. Moreover, people with competitive mentality would treat others with *authoritarian approach*, focusing on the *power and position* rather than the *principle*.
	
- Habit 4 is a belief that *the Third Alternative* exists, taking us out of the dichotomous mentality of Win vs Loss. *Win/Win is a **cooperative mentality***. It comes from "our ***character,*** then moves towards our ***relationship***, out of which flow ***agreements***,. It is nurtured in an environment ***structures*** and ***systems*** are based on Win/Win. And it involves ***process***, which encourage Win/Win." Win/Win provides a direction of *interpersonal relationship (interpersonal leadership)*.
  
- We can work on building a **Win/Win mindset** using our character of *integrity, maturity in combination with an **abundance mentality***.[^1] Besides this, the author suggested that we also need to design better *reward systems*. Such system designs should reflect the values and principles in our mission statement and should be aligned with our personal goals. Finally, we need to adopt various **principled negotiation strategies** in the process. [^2]
  
- Finally, the author argues that obtaining Win/Win requires not only skills but also our *characters* and *the level of accumulated trusts* during our past interactions with people. In return, thinking Win/Win would also help us accumulate trusts and improve our relationship with others. _The end and the means are the same._
