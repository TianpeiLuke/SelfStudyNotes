## Chapter Summary

- **Part 1: Paradigms and Principles.** This part presents the main argument of the book, i.e. forming a principle-centered paradigm. 
  
	- **Inside-Out**. This chapter presents the main approach of this book -- the *character ethic* approach and compare it with the popular *personality ethic* approach. The author, who is restoring an old paradigm, argues that the ***behaviors*** and ***attitudes***, the two main focuses on ***personality ethic*** trait, are *secondary* to ***character***. Without correct principles and fundamental character strength, skills on behaviors and attitudes will fade quickly and our true self will resurface. 
	  
	  Then the author argues that through ***paradigm shift*** from *personality ethics* to *character ethics*, we will change our perspective, understanding and interpreting to the world and circumstances. This paradigm shift is via forming a ***principle-centered paradigm***. *Paragidm* is our internal model of the world and *principles* are *self-evident* guidelines to human conduct with *enduring values*. In this book, the author argues that one individual's internal world model should live in harmony with the correct principles so that he/she can have a correct map to maximize the personal and interpersonal effectiveness.

	- **The Seven Habits: an Overview.**  This chapter introduces the definitions of ***habits*** and ***effectiveness***, two keywords in the book's title. This chapter also presents the ***maturity continuum***, which introduces the concept of dependent, **independent** and **interdependent**. The latter two are the focus on part 2 and part 3, respectively. The main point of this chapter is to argue that *effectiveness lies in **the balance of production (P) and production capacity (PC)***. Overall, this chapter is an introduction chapter  and it provides a high-level overviews of the topics discussed in the later chapters of the book.
