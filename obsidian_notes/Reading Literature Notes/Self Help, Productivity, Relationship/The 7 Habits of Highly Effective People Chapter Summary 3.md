## Chapter Summary

- **Part 3: Public Victory**. This part concerns about the **interpersonal relationship management**. From the author's perspective, "***effective interdependence can only be built on a foundation of true independence***". *Private Victory precedes Public Victory*. 
  
- *The ultimate **goal*** is to *raise the level of **trusts** among individuals*. In the process of ***earning trusts***, we adopt the *motives* of **Win/Win interactions (Habit 4)}** and the *skills* of **Empathetic Communications (Habit 5)**. Finally, it results in a situation where all parties in a group obtain **Synergy (Habit 6)** in *creative cooperation*. [^1]
  
	- **Paradigms of Interdependence**: This chapter discuss *the paradigm of interdependence*. Unlike *the paradigm of independence*, which involves development of principled center and then working from inside out to reach effective in personal life, the interdependence is built upon *trusts* among individuals. In this chapter, the author use the metaphor of "***Emotional Bank Account***" to describe *the level of trusts accumulated between people. 
	  
	  The central point in this chapter is that our *character, actions and communications* would affect the amount of trusts that the other people have towards us. Such trusts and distrusts can be *accumulated*, which is described as *deposit* and *withdrawal*. The paradigms of interdependence is to maintain and earn people's trusts towards us. 
	  
	  "How to earn trust?" The author's suggestions can be summarized as the following 
		- *Understanding the Individual*
		- *Attending to the Little Things*
		- *Keeping Commitments*
		- *Clarifying the Expectations*
		- *Showing Personal Integrity*
		- *Apologizing Sincerely When You Make a Withdrawal*
		  
	Finally, the author suggested that *the differences between people's perspectives would give us an opportunities to build a deep relationship*. "_Every P problem is a PC opportunity._" Thus we should always appreciate our differences.



[^1]: This part corresponds to the **social awareness** and **relationship management** in *the Emotional Intelligence 2.0*. It also covers the **principled negotiations** in *Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In*.
