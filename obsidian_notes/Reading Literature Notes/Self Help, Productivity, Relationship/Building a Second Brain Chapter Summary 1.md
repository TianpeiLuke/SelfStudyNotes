## Part I The Foundation: Understanding What’s Possible

- This part covers the major objectives of the book, i.e. *what is the **Second Brain*** and *how to build a **Second Brain***. 
- In this book, the Second Brain is an external *personal knowledge management system*. 
- The target audience of this book is *the knowledge workers*, people who need to deal with extensive knowledge exchange in their career and life.
- The basic *building blocks* for the personal knowledge management system are **notes**. Note is a *"discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head."*
- This book focus on how to take notes that facilitate knowledge digestion, development and knowledge sharing. 
- **Chapter 1** deal with author's personal story on note-taking and Second Brain development
- **Chapter 2** discuss the concept of the Second Brain.
- **Chapter 3** first introduced the **four essential capabilities** of the Second Brain:
	- It makes our ideas **concrete**.
		- By writing it down in notes, we *off-load* our ideas and turn them into *visible*, concrete words. Through notes, we can observe, rearrange, edit, and combine ideas together.
		- We can also *clear the clutter* in our mind. This helps reduce stress. [[Getting Things Done Book Summary]]
		- [[How to Take Smart Note Benefits of Smart Note-Taking]]
	- It reveals **new associations** between ideas.
		- "By keeping diverse kinds of material *in one place*, we facilitate this *connectivity* and increase the likelihood that we’ll notice an *unusual association*."
		- We can let different ideas mingle together in Second Brain. 
		- [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 3]]
		- [[How to Take Smart Note Benefits of Smart Note-Taking]]
	- It **incubates** our ideas **over time**.
		- ***Recency Bias***: people tend to favor the ideas, solutions, and influences that occurred to us *most recently*, regardless of whether they are the best ones. 
		- Taking notes and saving them in the Second Brain help to mitigate such bias.
		- Creativity develops through *"slow hunch"*, gradually build up to the *critical mass*. 
		- [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 2]]
	- It **sharpens** our unique **perspectives**.
		- The ultimate purpose of Second Brain is to apply the learned knowledge to "*advance a particular point of view and persuade others to adopt it as well*."
		- "Advocating for a particular point of view isn’t just a matter of sparkling charisma or irresistible charm. **It takes supporting material.**"
		- When we got stuck in thinking, it means that we have not yet acquired all supporting materials in our Second Brain. 
- **Chapter 3** then mentioned ***three stages** of personal management*:
	- **remembering**: The immediate use case for Second Brain is to store useful information while we encountered them.  The first stage of usage for Second Brain is to be a memory unit. 
	- **connecting**: The second level of usage for the Second Brain is to be a **thinking tool**. [^1]
	- **creating**. The ultimate purpose of using the Second Brain is to engage in **creative thinking.**
- Finally, **Chapter 3** provides an overview of the main workflow in BASB book: the **CODE** workflow
	- **Capture**: due to vast amount of information available, we need to learn how to capture useful and relevant information.
		- Capture section focus on how to be selective in information ingestion. 
		- "our goal should be to “capture” only the *ideas and insights* we think are *truly noteworthy*."
		- "The solution is to **keep only what resonates in a trusted place that you control**, and to **leave the rest aside**" 
		- The habit of capturing information as soon as possible allows us to let our mind rest in peace. 
	- **Organize**: [^3] 
		- The key in this section is to organize notes according to ***"actionability"***. 
		- The author urges us to abandon the traditional organization according to "topics".
		- The author also suggests to not to be too strict in organization. We should "**avoid organizing methods** that are **overly rigid and prescriptive.**"
		- Organize notes by action to take allows us to focus on goals and purpose. 
	- **Distill**:
		- To facilitate review, we just keep the essence of the information that are relevant to us. 
		- We take **progressive summarization** method to distill our notes down to their essence.
		- Think of yourself not just as a **taker** of notes, but as a **giver** of notes—you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand.
	- **Express**: [^4]
		- The ultimate purpose of learning is to express ourselves to others. 
		- The methods of expression include producing, exercising, writing, discussing, attending conferences/meetings etc. [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 3]]
		- After we digested information, we need to take next step to apply it. "*Information becomes knowledge only when we put it to use.*"
		- We should use our knowledge to help others. 
		- We need to "shift as much of your time and effort as possible **from consuming to creating.**"
		- No need to wait until you are ready. "Information is always **in flux**, and it is always a work in progress." [[Where Research Begins Book Chapter Summary]]

##  Recommended Notes

- *Building A Second Brain (BASB)* can be seen as an extension of the GTD principles for digital applications. See details of GTD in  [[Getting Things Done Book Summary]]
- The idea of externalization of processing in systems of notes can be seen in Zettelkasten method discussed in [[How to Take Smart Note Book Summary]]. We can check on webpage.
- The concept of "writing it down" has been discussed in [[How to Take Smart Note Book Summary]] and [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]]
