## Part III  The Shift: Making Things Happen

- This part promotes a *paradigm shift* on how we read, think, write via Second Brain. The author also discussed how to develop *habits* that boost *creativity* and encourage *self-expression* via Second Brain. 
  
- **The Art of Creative Execution.** This chapter discuss the creative process and how the Second Brain and the CODE workflow would boost creativity.
	- *"Building a Second Brain is really about **standardizing** the way we work"* [^1]
	- The main topic is the **divergence** and **convergence patterns** underlies the creative process. 
	  
	- **Divergence Pattern**: 
		- In the early stage, the task is to *collect as much information as possible* and *expand our searches*. We *dive deep* into the problem and *raise various questions* that lead us to many paths and *possibilities*.[^2]  We search through various primary sources and expand our keywords. 
		- In this stage, we allow ourselves to be *vulnerable to be influenced* by external sources in order to *understand the problem deeply*.
		- *"the purpose of divergence is to **generate new ideas**, so the process is necessarily **spontaneous, chaotic, and messy**."*
		- *"You **can’t fully plan or organize** what you’re doing in divergence mode, and you shouldn’t try. This is the time to wander."*
		- The first two stages in CODE: **Capture** and **Organize** are associated with the divergence pattern. *"This is where you research, explore, and add ideas."*
		  
	- **Convergence Pattern**:
		- *"As powerful and necessary as divergence is, if all we ever do is diverge, then we never arrive anywhere."*
		- After collecting a *critical mass* of information, we need to develop our own thoughts, choosing one path out of many possibilities. This is the convergence stage.
		- *"**Convergence forces us to eliminate options**, **make trade-offs**, and **decide what is truly essential.**"*
		- In convergence stage, the task is to *narrow down the range of possibilities* and *converge* to one solution. [^3]
		- The last two stages in CODE: **Distill** and **Express** are associated with the convergence pattern. *"They help us shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge building blocks we’ve assembled."*
		  
	- In this chapter, the author introduced **three strategies** that brings creative work together:
		- **The Archipelago of Ideas**: 
			- This is a metaphor for *a collection of notes* that contain *ideas*, *references* and *evidences* from various different sources. These notes are *backbone* of our argument. 
			- The author suggests to use the **outlining technique** to list out the points we want to make up front. 
			- Outlining is useful since it is *searchable*, *interactive*, *malleable*, *flexible*, *easy to edit* and can *link* to other notes and references.
			- *"An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most difficulty performing at the same time: **choosing ideas** (known as **selection**) and **arranging** them into a **logical flow** (known as **sequencing**)."*
			- We can avoid the multi-tasking and focus on selection first and then arrangement. 
			- Using the *Archipelago of Ideas*, we will not worry about blank page. No one ever start from the scratch. [^4]
			- *"Instead of starting with scarcity, **start with abundance—the abundance of interesting insights you’ve collected in your Second Brain.**"* [^5]
			  
		- **The Hemingway Bridge**:
			- This refer to the strategy that deliberately leave a *hook at end of each day* so that we would know what to do the next day. 
			- *"He built himself a **bridge to the next day**, using **today’s energy and momentum to fuel tomorrow’s writing.**"*
			- *The Hemingway Bridge* is all about how to keep and extend the momentum of creative process to other day. 
			- The Hemingway Bridge would *link isolated pieces of information together* by identifying what to do next and reserving it for the next day. [^6]
			- We shall not deplete all of our mental energies in one day. *" keep some energy and imagination **in reserve** and use it as a **launchpad for the next step** in your progress."*
			- How do you create a Hemingway Bridge?
				- **Write down ideas for next steps**
				- **Write down the current status**
				- **Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away**:
				- **Write out your intention for the next work session**
			- In essence, we write down the current status for continual work in the next day. (Just like how parallel computing and multi-task processor works in operation system.)
			  
		- **Dial Down the Scope**:
			- In Software management, the ***Scope*** refers to **the full set of features** a software program might include.
			- This strategy is to *flexibly adjust the problem* according to our current resources such as priorities, time, skills etc.
			- This strategy is in contrast to the *procrastination and delay strategy* that most of people would use when facing challenges in completing the project. 
			- *"Dialing Down the Scope recognizes that **not all the parts of a given project are equally important.** By dropping or reducing or postponing the least important parts, we can **unblock ourselves and move forward even when time is scarce.**"*
			- In essence, this strategy let us recognize that *we are the owner of our own projects*. We  can decide what to do and what not to do. 
			- The good thing is that *our Second Brain would keep all the abandoned information*. This allow us to *recycle* them and use them for other projects. One of main benefits for the Second Brain is that *nothing really lost in the system.* [^7] 
			  
	- **Divergence and convergence are not a linear path**, but a loop. [^8]

- **The Essential Habits of Digital Organizers.** This chapter is on how to *develop good habits* that boost productivity and creativity. [^9]
	- *"Your Second Brain is a practical system for enhancing your **productivity** and your **creativity**"*
	- To boost *productivity*, one requires *concrete goals* and *defined processes*; while to boost *creativity*, one requires *abstractions* and *open-ended processes*.
	- *"When we are **organized and efficient**, that **creates space for creativity to arise**. When we have confidence in our creative process, we don’t have to think about it as much, significantly reducing the background stress of constantly worrying whether we’re going in the right direction."*
	- The benefits of being organized is to clear the clutter and to reduce the burden in our mind. This leaves spaces for creative work. 
	- At each step of CODE, there are habits that can help us be more organized so that our creativity has space to arise.
	  
	- In this chapter, the author introduced **three kinds of habits** that can be integrated into your routine to ensure your Second Brain remains functional and relevant. [^10]
		- **Project Checklists**: Ensure we start and finish our projects in a consistent way, making use of past work.
		- **Weekly and Monthly Reviews**: Periodically review our work and life and decide if we want to change anything. 
		- **Noticing Habits**: Notice small opportunities to edit, highlight, or move notes to *make them more discoverable* for your future self.
		  
	- These habits are the **“maintenance schedule”** of the Second Brain. They define the workflow that maintain the Second Brain functional in long term. 
	  
	- **The Project Checklist Habit**: This include **Project Kickoff Checklist** and **Project Completion Checklist**.
		- At Kickoff phase, we need to check:
			- **Capture** my current thinking on the project.
			- **Review** folders (or *tags*) that might contain relevant notes.
			- **Search** for related terms across all folders.
			- **Move** (or *tag*) relevant notes to the project folder.
			- **Create an outline** of collected notes and **plan** the project.
			- Other things include: **answering critical questions**, **communication with stakeholders**, **define success criteria**, **official kickoff announcement**.
		- At completion phase, we need to check:
			- **Mark** project as **complete** in task manager or project management app.
			- **Cross out** the associated project goal and **move to “Completed” section**.
			- **Review** Intermediate Packets and **move** them to other folders.
			- **Move** project to **archives** across all platforms.
			- If project is becoming inactive: **add a current status note** to the project folder **before archiving**.
			- Other things include: **communication with stakeholders**, **evaluate success criteria**, **announcement and celebration**.
		- ![[review_feedback_detail.png]]
		  
	- **The Review Habit**: this process involves review the action items, clear inbox, check tasks and notes. The weekly review process is essential to many *project management strategies* such as *Kanban*, *Scrum* etc. We can refer to [[Getting Things Done Book Summary]] for more details. 
	  
	- **The Noticing Habits**: 
		- This habit is to *notice every small opportunities* to capture information that would *otherwise be missed*. Treat every opportunity of capturing critical information as the last opportunities. 
		- When applying to captured notes, one important suggestion is to **make a note** more **actionable or discoverable** whenever we visit it. 
		- *"it needs to be done **a little at a time** in the **flow of our normal lives**. It needs to be done in the **in-between moments** of moving your projects forward as you notice small opportunities for improvement."*
		  
	- The final reminder is that "the **maintenance** of your Second Brain is very **forgiving**". No need to be perfect in any of this process, but to *make it easy* and *make it satisfying*. [^9]
	  
- **The Path of Self-Expression.** In the last chapter, the author advocates *several paradigm shifts* that that are associated with the system of Second Brain. This is to help us to be *effective* in thinking, learning and writing. 
	- *"Any change in how we interact with information first requires a change in how we **think**."*
	- *"it is never a person’s toolset that constrains their potential, it’s their **mindset**."*
	- With the Second Brain, we can free up memory spaces in our brain and focus on thinking. [^11]
		- *"You’ll be more **balanced and peaceful** ... You will be more **trusting** ... You will be more **open-minded** .... You’ll want to expose yourself to more diverse perspectives, from more people, without necessarily committing to any single one. You’ll become a curator of perspectives, free to pick and choose the beliefs and concepts that serve you best in any given situation."*
		  
	- **The Shift from Scarcity to Abundance**: [^12]
		- *"The **paradox of hoarding** is that **no matter how much we collect and accumulate, it’s never enough.**"*
		- The key is end the scarcity loop is to *trust* our Second Brain to capture and maintain a *sufficient* amount of high quality information. This way we do not need to consume all information available to us or to understand everything. 
		- *"**All we need is a few seeds of wisdom**, and the seeds we most need tend to **continually find us again and again**."*
		- The paradigm shift from scarcity to abundance is to "**let go of low-value information that seems important, but that doesn’t make us better people.**"
		  
	- **The Shift from Obligation to Service**: [^13]
		- We use the Second Brain not only for **remembering**, but for **connecting and creating**.
		- Our Second Brain drives us to be the owner of our own thinking and learning. It pushes us to be **proactive**.
		- With a proactive system, we will *"transition from doing things primarily **out of obligation** or **pressure** to doing things from a spirit of **service**."*
		- Given sufficient information at hands, there is no excuse to wait and to delay our actions. 
		- *"The purpose of knowledge is to be shared."* Our Second Brain would encourage ourselves to share with others. [^14]
		  
	- **The Shift from Consuming to Creating**:
		- *"The practice of building a Second Brain is more than the sum of capturing facts, theories, and the opinions of others. At its core, it is about **cultivating self-awareness and self-knowledge**. When you encounter an idea that **resonates** with you, it is because that idea **reflects back to you** something that is already within you. **Every external idea is like a mirror**, surfacing within us the truths and the stories that want to be told."*
		- We know more than we can speak. By using the Second Brain, we can *extract the hidden knowledge in ourselves* that cannot be described by ourselves in detail. The process of seeking resonates serves this purpose. 
		- The process of developing our Second Brain is to discover the **tacit knowledge**.
		- *"There is a universe of thoughts and ideas and emotions within you. Over time, you can uncover new layers of yourself and new facets of your identity. **You search outside yourself to search within yourself**, knowing that **everything you find has always been a part of you**."*
		  
	- The last message from the author is that "**self-expression is a fundamental human need**."  The world is desperate to hear what you know. You can change lives by sharing yourself with others.
