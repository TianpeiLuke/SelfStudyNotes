## Part II  The Method: The Four Steps of CODE

- This part discussed in detail the four steps of C.O.D.E., i.e. **Capture**, **Organize**, **Distill** and **Express**. CODE provides a workflow and framework that allow us to develop our Second Brain and use it for our knowledge management and creative works.

- **Capture**: The subtitle of this chapter is ***"Keep what resonates"***. The first step of developing personal knowledge management system is to extract information from the **outside world**, either real life or digital life, and **inside world**, our understanding and thoughts. 
	- The **central argument** from author is that we should be **selective** and just capture what is **relevant** to us, **attracts** us or **inspires** us. 
	- The author mentioned **"Curator’s Perspective"** - *"we are the judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our lives."*
	- *"As you consume a piece of content, listen for an internal feeling of being moved or surprised by the idea you’re taking in."* [^1] 
	- *"knowledge asset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience."* This includes outside knowledge and insider knowledge

		- Musings
	- **Capture Criteria**:
		- ***Does It Inspire Me?***
		- ***Is It Useful?***
		- ***Is It Personal?***
		- ***Is It Surprising?***
	- It may be not clear at beginning the meaning of a piece of information to us. Thus we need to store them and **revisit** them later on. This way we are also able to understand it from a **different perspective**. [^2] 
	- Knowledge capture is natural in our life. We just need to take little extra efforts to save them in one place. ***"The secret to making reading a habit is to make it effortless and enjoyable."*** [^3] 
	- The author also mentions that there are somethings *not to keep* in one place, such as sensitive information, special format files, large files or shareable files. 
	- To sparkle our curiosity and motivate us to search for new information, we need to keep asking us **open-ended questions**. The author suggests us to maintain a set of open-ended questions and *raise these questions* at beginning of new projects. [^4]
	  
- **Organize**: The subtitle of this chapter is ***"Save for actionability"***. The second step is also a critical step is to organize saved materials. According to the author, all information saved in Second Brain serves for a *purpose* and should be used as support or reminder to *next actions*. 
	- A **central proposal** of the book is the ***P.A.R.A system***, which is a hierarchical system that group information according to how actionable are they. 
	- Separation of Capture and Organize means that we **do not need to make a decision** on where to put the captured notes **immediately**. The first step focuses on introspection on personal interest. The second step focuses on saving information for long term. 
	- **P.A.R.A** system is motivated by *Getting Things Done (GTD)* by David Allan, esp. ***the Next Action principle.*** [^5]
	- *"Instead of organizing ideas according to where they come from, I recommend organizing them according to **where they are going**—specifically, the **outcomes** that they can help you realize."*
	- P.A.R.A is a dynamic system so it is important to be flexible. 
	  
	- P.A.R.A system consists of four categories
		1. **Projects**: *Short-term* efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now.
		2. **Areas**: *Long-term responsibilities* you want to manage over time.
		3. **Resources**: Topics or interests that *may be useful* in the future.
		4. **Archives**: *Inactive items* from the other three categories.
		   
	- **Project**: represents short-term low-effort effort. 
		- Each project has *a complete life cycle* with beginning and end. 
		- Projects have *concrete objectives* and *action items*. 
		- Projects need to clearly define *success criteria* and to have *expected outcome.*
		- Projects are units of low-level time management and prioritization.  
		- [[Concepts and Operations in Project Management]]
		- [[Project Definition]]
		- [[Project Management Life Cycle]]
		- [[Project Initiation Key Components]]
		- [[Project Initiation Identifying Goals]]
		- [[Project Initiation Measuring Success]]
		- [[Project Execution Tracking]]
		  
	- **Area**: defines our roles and responsibilities that need long term maintenance. 
		- Areas are associated with our *roles* and the corresponding expectations.
		- Areas have clear definition of *scope*, which defines where our ownership/responsibility ends. 
		- Areas do not have clear end time but need *continual efforts* for long term management.
		- Areas are essentially not managed but to be led by **principles**. Handling area of responsibility need *top-down approach* with ***Principles of Personal Vision*** and ***Principles of Personal Leadership***. [^6] See more comparison between projects and areas in [[Define Area vs. Define Project]]
		- Inclusion of the concept of *Area* is beyond *GTD*.
		- [[Program Definition]]
		- [[Portfolio Definition]]
		- [[Project Initiation Identifying Scope]]
		- [[Project Initiation Identifying and Working with Stakeholders]]
		- [[Project Execution Continuous Improvement]]
		  
	- **Resource**: include information that are *not immediately actionable* but would be kept closely for use *in near future*.
		- Resources are not to be confused with supporting materials and information within Project and Area scope. 
		- *"Resource"* is a folder that serve the same purpose of *"Sometime/Maybe"* folder in GTD. [^5]
		- Original material under Resources should be kept in a **Reference Management System**, as suggested by *Zettelkasten*. We can keep a *literature note* that refers to the original materials and highlights the main points. [[How to Take Smart Note Workflow]] [^6]
		- For research, *"Resources"* folder keep *primary and secondary sources*.
		- [[Project Initiation Essential Project Resources and Tools]]
		  
	- **Archive**: contains all *completed* projects, *uncommitted* areas and *inactive* action items and information that are *no longer relevant*. 
		- Archive is a dump of all information in the past. No longer associated with active actions. 
		- *"The archives are an important part of PARA because they allow you to place a folder in **“cold storage”** so that it doesn’t clutter your workspace, while **safekeeping it forever** just in case you need it. "*
		- Archive exists to push distracted matters out of our mind. 
		  
	- Some additional lessons from the chapter:
		- *"Using PARA is not just about creating a bunch of folders to put things in. It is about **identifying the structure of your work and life**—what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go."*  
		- **People need clear workspaces to be able to create**. 
		- **Creating new things is what really matters.**
		- **Completed creative projects are the blood flow of your Second Brain.** We need to accumulate small wins to keep our momentum. 
		- **Move quickly and touch lightly.** Making it easy to form a habit.
		  
- **Distill**: The subtitle of this chapter is ***"Find the essence"***. The third step is **unique**  as the author proposed a novel way to *balance* the *abundance of information* available and the *lack* of enough *time* for knowledge workers to *review* them.
	- The main proposal in this chapter is the process of ***Progressive Summarization.***
	- ***Progressive Summarization*** emphasized the ***discover-ability*** of the information within the Second Brain. The author argues that we shall organize our information in a way so that it is easy to discover what it contains and to get access to a specific point with *little extra efforts*. 
	- *"Your job as a notetaker is to **preserve the notes** you’re taking on the things you discover in such a way that **they can survive the journey into the future**."*
	- Progressive summarization allows us to *adjust the level of information* to keep in our Second Brain according to our needs *with minimal efforts.* 
		- It strike a balance between the effort of *summarization* and the effort of *reviewing*. 
		- High level summary requires more effort in reading and comprehension, but it is easier to review the essence. 
		- Excerpts and Highlights are easier to capture but take more time to review. 
	- Progressive summarization takes advantages of the **compounding effects** in knowledge accumulation. The strength of Second Brain increases as more distilled notes accumulate to a **critical mass**.  [^6] [^7]
	  
	- The workflow of Progressive Summarization is hierarchical from **bottom-up.** ![[basb_progress_summarization.png]]
	- Steps of Progressive Summarization:
		- **Extract Excerpts from Captured Notes**. Do not keep all of original note. Usually less than 20% of text.
		- **Highlight Passages with Bold**. All I have to do is *bold the main points* within the note. This could include *keywords* that provide hints of what this text is about, *phrases* that capture what the original author was trying to say, or *sentences *that especially resonated with me even if I can’t explain why.
		- **Highlight over Highlighted Passages**. This will often amount to just one or two sentences that encapsulate the message of the original source. Use bullet points and checklists if necessary. 
		- **Paraphrase or Summarize the Paragraphs**. Use our own word [^8].
		  
	- The **key** of Progressive Summarization is to realize that not every note need to be paraphrased in our own word. Also not every piece of information need extensive processing. We are allowed to keep half-raw information as long as it is helpful for us to find what we want later on. The same idea applies to reading: **not every book need to be read in detail.** [^9] The level of efforts depends on the purpose of reading.  
	- The **hierarchical structure** of progressive summarization allows us to **zoom in and out** of our Second Brain. We zoom out to gain broader picture of the problem and we zoom in to acquire details. We can **customized our attention** depending on our time, and our focus. [^10]
	- This chapter also addresses some **common mistakes**:
		- **Over-Highlighting**: *"You don’t need to and shouldn’t include every tiny detail."* For each layer, only keep no more than 20% of text from previous layer. 
		- **Highlighting without Purpose**: *Summarization and Distillation takes time and effort.* So only do highlighting when "we are ready to create something." 
		- **Make Highlight Complicated**: follow our internal voice and highlight it when it resonate with us. *Don’t worry about analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing each point to decide whether to highlight it*
		  
- **Express**: The subtitle of this chapter is ***"Show your work"***. The last step is to use our Second Brain in creative works and to make contributions to community and society. [^11]
	- *"Express, is about **refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly** ready before you share what you know."*
	- *"As knowledge workers, **attention is our most scarce and precious resource.**"* We are constantly facing challenges that distracts our attentions. The Second Brain gives us *strategical advantages* to *freely and intentionally allocate attentions*. 
	- In this chapter, the author suggest reader to express our ideas *earlier*, *more frequently* and in *small chunks* to collect *feedback* from our peers before everything is ready. [^13]
	- The main topics in this chapter is on **the atomic note structure**, which is referred to as **"Intermediate Packets"** in the book. [^12]  
	- *"**Intermediate Packets** are the concrete, individual building blocks that make up your work."*
	- The **benefits** of using small intermediate packets are:
		- Using atomic notes, we are forced to *divide* complex matters into smaller pieces and to think in concrete "small" form. 
		- Intermediate packets are to be *reused* in multiple projects, and connected to each other to form our Second Brain.
		- Doing smaller piece of work are *not easy to be interrupted* since we can finish it fast in the middle of other works. (*Interrupt-proof.*)
		- We can utilize the *compound effect* to gradually accumulate works and making continual progress within any span of time. 
		- Using the form of Intermediate Packet, we can *collect feedback more often*. This would increase the quality of our work. 
		- Finally, we can easily assemble previous stored Intermediate Packets to create new projects. *"Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch"* [^13]
	- This chapter discussed **four retrieval methods**:
		1. **Search**: keyword based search
		2. **Browsing**: go over folders and file system
		3. **Tags**: retrieval through tags
		4. **Serendipity**: retrieval through connections
	- Three stages of expressing:
		- **Remember: Retrieve an Idea Exactly When It’s Needed**
		- **Connect: Use Notes to Tell a Bigger Story**
		- **Create: Complete Projects and Accomplish Goals Stress-Free**
	- *"It is much easier to show someone a small thing, and ask for their thoughts on it."* 
	- *"Getting feedback is really about borrowing someone else’s eyes to see what only a novice can see. It’s about **stepping outside your subjective point of view** and noticing **what’s missing** from what you’ve made."*
	- It is critical to reframe and *measure productivity* in terms of *atomic notes (intermediate packets).* We are able to reuse previous notes to accumulate and spark new creative works. [^14]
	- A quote from the book on self-expression 

 >[!quote]
> To truly “know” something, it’s not enough to read about it in a book. **Ideas are merely thoughts until you put them into action.** Thoughts are fleeting, quickly fading as time passes. To truly make an idea stick, you have to engage with it. You have to get your hands dirty and **apply that knowledge to a practical problem.** We **learn by making concrete things**—before we feel ready, before we have it completely figured out, and before we know where it’s going.

[^1]: Similar suggestion appears when we are doing early phase of research and developing our questions. See [[Where Research Begins Book Chapter Summary]] as well as exercises [[Where Research Begins Exercise 01 Search Yourself]], [[Where Research Begins Exercise 02 Let Boredom Be Your Guide]]

[^2]: It is beneficial to adapt the Zettelkasten method as system to capture information in consistent way. Paraphrasing information in our own word forces us to read it from different perspective. [[How to Take Smart Note Benefits of Smart Note-Taking]]

[^3]: "Making it easy" is a key law in developing habits. Check [[Atomic Habits Book Summary]]

[^4]: Check on [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]] and their exercises to find open-ended questions for early research. 

[^5]: David Allan discuss organization according to *the "Next Action" principle*, which is the key principle behind PARA. [[Getting Things Done Book Summary]]. However, PARA would be more broader since it covers higher level *area of responsibility* and lower level *projects*. The *Resources* folder corresponds to the *"Sometimes/Maybe"* folder in GTD. In GTD, the inactive items may be deleted but in digital world, PARA can just *archive* them without wasting spaces. 

[^6]: Area of responsibility coincides with the concept of Circle of Influence in [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 2 Vision Leadership Management]]. To understand how to take actions within the Area of responsibility, we need to apply *the Principles of Personal Vision* and *the Principles of Personal Leadership*.  

[^6]: Use literature notes would serve as both Organize and Distill functionality since the literature note itself is not the original material but a distilled abstract of it.  

[^7]: These are the same benefits of using Zettelkasten. See *"Simplicity is Paramount"* in [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 2]]

[^8]: Unlike Zettelkasten, Progressive Summarization allows us to keep extracted or highlighted original text instead to forcing us to write with our own word for every piece of information. This is an intermediate step between fleeting notes and literature notes. 

[^9]: In *"How to Read A Book"* by Mortimer J Adler etc. the author suggests three level of reading: ***Elementary Reading**, **Inspectional Reading** and **Analytical Reading***. The progressive summarization corresponding to different level of reading, with increasing effort.

[^10]: Attention customization is mentioned in the benefits of using Zettelkaten in "*Separate and Interlocking Tasks*" .[[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 3]]  

[^11]: CODE follows the *"introversion first, extroversion second"* approach in [[Where Research Begins Book Summary]]

[^12]: The atomic note structure that compress information and chunk them in smaller pieces is the major characteristics of the Zettelkasten method. [[The definitive feature of Zettelkasten]], [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 1]]

[^13]: "*Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch*" is the message from [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 2]] as well. Also "Let the Work Carry You Forward" talks about the benefits of using atomic notes to ask feedback often.

[^14]:  The same point is raised in "Take Smart Notes" in [[How to Take Smart Note Chapter Part 3]]
