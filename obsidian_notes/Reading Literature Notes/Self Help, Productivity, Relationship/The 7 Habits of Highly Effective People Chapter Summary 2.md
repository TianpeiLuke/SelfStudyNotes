## Chapter Summary

- **Part 2: Private Victory**. This part concerns about the personal ***self-development***. The ultimate goal is to form an *independent and matured character* of our own. In particular, the author stated that a *habit* is defined as an *intersection of **knowledge**, **skill** and **desire***. Then in the following three chapters, the author address the issues of *desire* (via our ***personal vision***), *knowledge* (via our ***personal leadership***) and *skill* (via our ***personal management***). Note that *skills* come last, which reflect the author's perspective based on the *character ethic approach*. [^1]
  
	- **Habit 1: Be Proactive -- Principles of Personal Vision**. This chapter addresses the issue of _Desire_ -- "Do we _want to_ lead an effective life?". The author raised the readers' desire to commit to a paradigm shift in our character. It is argued that "We are the _Creator_." In particular, 
		- we are ***responsible*** for our own life.
		- we have ***freedom*** to choose our responses in our life. 
		  And the Habit 1, being ***proactive*** means:
		- ***taking initiatives***, to _act instead of being acted upon_ by others or environment;
		- recognizing and taking *responsibility*;
		- focus on ***Circle of Influence***; only act when we have ***direct control*** or ***indirect control***; and we should _be content with things outside Circle of Influence_, i.e. things that we have no control of;
		- making and keeping ***commitments***.
		
		The author argued that human response are not purely reactive to the stimulus of our environment. We are also not a true reflection of our ***social mirror***. To the opposite, we have *freedom* to make choice through *four unique human endowments*:  
		- **Self-awareness**,  
		- **Imagination**
		- **Conscience**
		- **Independent Will**.  
		These four characteristics are the basis of the proposed proactivity model}. Throughout the book, the proactive model and the four human endowments are repeatedly mentioned. 
		
		The _habit of proactivity_ helps us to make commitments to start our transition to new paradigms. It gives us the initial force to push us forward.
		
	- **Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind -- Principles of Personal Leadership.** This chapter addresses the issue of _Knowledge}_ -- "_What_ to do to lead an effective life and _Why_?" The author used the term "__Begin with the End in Mind__" which means that _envisioning a clear destination at the beginning of journey._  By knowing where are you going, you will have a better understanding of where are you now and whether or not you are heading in the right direction. The author encouraged us to use _imagination_ and _conscience_ to visualize and affirm an ideal image of ourselves _in minds_.  
	  
		 - In this chapter, _the main proposal_ is to develop a ***personal mission statement***, a *personal constitution*. Such personal mission statement includes *what you want to be, to do and the values or principles upon which your identity and your actions are based*. And the personal mission statement is separated according to *roles* and *goals*, which provides *structual directions* to our personal mission. According to the author, "*with unchanging principles, we created a fundamental paradigm of effective living*". Our personal mission statement is a manifesto of our ideal destinations in mind.  It is our *mental creation*.
		   
		 - Behind the personal mission statement is our **centers**. In particular, our centers are the source of *four life-support factors*: 
			 - **security**, 
			 - **guidance**,
			 - **wisdom** and 
			 - **power**. 
			   In order to write a personal mission statement, we need to identify our ***principle center***, which is built upon the correct principles. By centering our life on correct principles, we put various other centers and roles in our life (*self, family, spouse, work, money, friend, enemy etc.*) into perspective and develop them in a **balanced way**. Note that these centers are at very center of our Circle of Influence. 
		
		Habit 2 is based on *the principle of Personal Leadership*. ***Personal leadership*** is "to determine the right things to do". "*We are more in need of a vision or destination and a compass and less in need of a road map.*" Personal leadership defines the criterion on *prioritization*, which is the focus on ***Personal Management***. According to the author, "*Personal Leadership comes before Personal Management.*" Effectiveness cannot be achieved if we are heading in the wrong direction.
		
		Finally, the author suggested us to "*take deep introspection, careful analysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrites*" to produce the final form of our personal mission statement, and then **review it regularly**. 
		
		The author also suggested us to continually develop our Personal Leadership by *expanding our perspective* with new experience, and by *visualizing* and *affirming* it *with respect to our principles*.
		
	- **Habit 3: Put First Things First -- Principles of Personal Management.** This chapter addresses the issue of _Skill_ -- "_How_ to lead an effective life?"  The answer to the question above can be summarized as
		- **Separating importance from urgency**;
		- **Always prioritizing importance over urgency**
		- **Focus on *important but Not urgent matters (Quadrant II)***
		"What are important matters?" Importance is measured by how much the results will contribute to our goals, missions and values, which are identified in Habit 2. "_Leadership_ decides on the first things and _management_ puts them first in routine activities."
		
		- The key in this chapter is ***Quadrant II focus***. *Quadrant I* represents *Crises*, and "*crises act on you not vice versa*." Thus Quadrant I is in effect out of our Circle of Influence. However, "*Quadrant II is within our Circle of Influence*. We have freedom to determine when to do it and how to do it. Moreover, the more we work on Quadrant II the less we will face them in Quadrant I. 
		  
		- The final product in this chapter is a ***Quadrant II Self-Manager***, who complete the work via
			- Identifying *Roles*;
			- Selecting *Goals*;
			- *Scheduling*;
			- Daily *Adapting*.
			  
			  The objective of Quadrant II management is to keep our life effective. 
			- it should maintain *integrity* and *coherence* to our *vision and mission*. 
			- It should keep **balance** in our life between multiple roles and goals. 
			- The key is "*not to prioritize what is on your schedule, but to **schedule your priorities***."
			- It maintains a "People" dimension, which subordinate of schedules to people.
			  
		*Mastering the Skill (Habit 3) is the result of understanding the Desire (Habit 1) and the Knowledge (Habit 2)*. Only through deep understanding of our intrinsic values and goals do we define the importance and thus the Quadrant II. By choosing to prioritize Quadrant II, we utilize our Habit 1 (Proactivity). Finally through Proactivity, we reach *effectiveness* in *time and life management*. 

[^1]: This part correlates to the ***self-awareness** and **self-management*** part in *emotional intelligence 2.0*. But this book emphasize the development of *characters* not only *behaviors*.
