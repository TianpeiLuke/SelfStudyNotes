## Chapter Summary

- **Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood -- Principles of Empathetic Communication.** This chapter addresses an important topic in relationship management, i.e. ***communications***. In specific, it presents a powerful principle: "*Seek first to understand, then to be understood*." Before we rush in to provide our own diagnose, we need to obtain data from others. ***Empathetic listening** is a critical communication skill in interdependent relationship management*.
  
- "*Seek first to understand*" is a critical *paradigm shift*. *Most people **listen with intent to reply**. But we should really **listen with intent to understand***. If you fail to understand others, you fail to **earn their trusts**, thus fail to **influence** them. It is hard to *diagnose before prescribe*, since understanding others first opens ourselves *to be vulnerable* to others' paradigms first. It thus requires *strong intrinsic security* and *integrity* in one's character to implement. *Being influence-able* is the key to *influencing others*. It is a great deposit to emotional bank account.
  
- In this chapter, we discussed the *four levels of listening*:
	- **ignoring**
	- **pretending**
	- **selective listening**
	- **empathetic listening**
	
	Here we see that only empathetic listening would give us accurate data about the other people, thus allows us to understand them. Through empathetic listening, we understand others' perspectives, which is the first step towards a Win/Win solution. 

- We should *reserve our judgement* to others before we understand them. Also we should *avoid autobiographical responses* first, such as *evaluate; probe; advise; interpret*. This is not about us. In empathetic listening, we **rephrase** the content and **reflect** the feeling. This is not only a communication skill but should also come from our own desire to understand, and our own character strength as well as the accumulated trusts the Emotional Bank Account we obtained from other people. 

- Finally, we need **to be understood**. *To be understood* is also important in Habit 5. It requires us to improve our communication skills, to present our idea *clearly, empathically, logically* and to express it with *courage*. In this chapter, the author presents the sequence *ethos, pathos, logos*, i.e. 
	- our character and the trusts we inspire (**ethos**);
	- our empathetic feelings (**pathos**);
	- the logic of our presentation (**logos**).
	  
	In the context of deep understanding other's paradigms and concerns, we can significantly improve the credibility of our ideas.
