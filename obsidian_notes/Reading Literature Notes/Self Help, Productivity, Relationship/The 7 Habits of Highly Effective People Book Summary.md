## Book Summary

- This is book for **personal development** and **relationship management**.  In this book, the author used a ***top-down, inside-out approach*** to help the readers to develop **effectiveness** in their personal life and in their relationship with others. 

- The ***effectiveness*** defined in this book lies in the ***balance** of **production (P)** and **production capacity (PC)***.

- This approach belongs to so called the ***character ethic*** approaches, which emphasizes that "there are *basic principles of effective living*, and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character."[[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 1 Paradigms and Principles]]
	- [[Developing the Leader Within You Chapter 03 Character]]

- The author's argument is that developing a ***principle center** of ourselves* is essential to form an *effective, mature, independent* individual, which becomes the foundation for *trustworthy*, *interdependent  relationships* with others. [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 2 Vision Leadership Management]]

 - The ***seven principles*** and the corresponding ***seven habits*** presented in this book are thus a part of a *sequential development process*. From *top to down*, from *inside to outside*, this process allows the reader to *introspect*, *evaluate* and then change their own *paradigms of life* and finally to live in harmony with their principles, their values in an ever-changing, challenging, interdependent environment.

- It is called ***Seven Habits***, but it is actually ***Five Habits (1-5)*** + a ***Looping Mechanism (Habit 7)*** + the ***Ideal Outcome (Habit 6)***.
