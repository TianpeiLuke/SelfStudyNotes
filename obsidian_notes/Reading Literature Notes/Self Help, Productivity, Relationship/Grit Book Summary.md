>In my view, the biggest reason a preoccupation with talent can be harmful is simple: By shining our spotlight on talent, we risk leaving everything else in the shadows. We inadvertently send the message that these other factors—including grit—don’t matter as much as they really do.
>-- *Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance*, pp 32

>[!quote]
>Grit grows as we figure out our *life philosophy*, learn to dust ourselves off after *rejection and disappointment*, and learn to tell the difference between *low-level goals* that should be abandoned quickly and *higher-level goals* that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the *capacity* for *long-term passion* and *perseverance* as we get older.”
