Most of the readings for this lesson focus on defining guiding principles or important processes that we'll be using throughout the rest of this course and specialization. The last article walks through a step-by-step process of creating a cloud-based CI/CD software solution that is housed in AWS. While optional, if you choose to follow these processes alongside the instructions, you'll experience workflows and pipelines that you can use to create your own solutions in the future.
