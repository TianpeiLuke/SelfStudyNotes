This lesson's additional readings are largely based on implementation of different kinds of important MLOps tools and workflows. Most of these articles are relatively brief in text, but provide a lot of extra documentation and opportunities to run examples of these new processes or workflows. Much of the example code shown in these readings could be reused to create your own workflows in the future as well, so if you choose to follow any of the instructions on your own, you'll wind up with some useful artifacts!

|Reading Title|Type|Length (minutes)|Brief Description|
