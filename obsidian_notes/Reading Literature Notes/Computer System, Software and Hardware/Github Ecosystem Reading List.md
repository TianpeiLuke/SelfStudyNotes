|[Scaling MLOps Education](https://github.com/readme/guides/mlops-education)|Interactive Tutorial|15-30|In this Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) video Guide, you'll learn how to utilize GitHub for maximizing developer efficiency and product innovation. The guide covers four major benefits: reproducibility (via GitHub Codespaces), access to machine learning technology, AI coding assistance, and CI/CD capabilities. You'll be walked through building GitHub Templates, creating a CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions, and configuring GitHub Codespaces environments with .devcontainer. You'll also learn how automation and AI pair programming, such as with GitHub Copilot, can help streamline these processes. The guide teaches you how to set up and use GitHub Actions, GitHub Codespaces with GPU-capable MLOps templates, and GitHub Copilot for AI pair programming.|

|[GitHub MLOps Template](https://github.com/nogibjj/mlops-template)|Interactive Tutorial|15-30|This repository provides a template for MLOps projects with GPU support. It uses the recommended tools from the Python Software Foundation, such as virtualenv, pip, and Docker, for a streamlined setup. As of December 2022, GitHub Codespaces are free for education, including GPU Codespaces. Upon launching, verify that the virtualenv is sourced.<br><br>The template includes a Makefile, Pytest, pandas, Pylint or ruff, Dockerfile, GitHub Copilot, Jupyter and IPython, common Python libraries for ML/DL, Hugging Face, and GitHub Actions. Additionally, it features two interesting tools: Zero-shot classification (./hugging-face/zero_shot_classification.py classify) and Yake for candidate label creation (./utils/kw_extract.py). This template is designed to help students quickly set up MLOps projects while exploring essential tools and libraries.|
