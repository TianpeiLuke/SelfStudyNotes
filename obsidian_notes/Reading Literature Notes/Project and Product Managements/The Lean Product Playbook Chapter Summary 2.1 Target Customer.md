## Part 2: The Lean Product Process

- The second part covers the six steps of the **Lean Product Process**, where each step is discussed in detail in one chapter (chapters 3 - 9). 
  
>[!important]
> The **Lean Product Process** guides you through the formulation and testing of your hypotheses with these **six steps**: 
> 1. Determine your **target customers** 
> 2. Identify **underserved** *customer needs* 
> 3. Define your **value proposition** 
> 4. Specify your **minimum viable product (MVP)** *feature set* 
> 5. Create your **MVP prototype** 
> 6. **Test** your MVP with *customers*
>

### Determine Your Target Customer

>[!quote]
>The problem space benefits you’re going to identify pertain to a *specific customer segment*. Different customers will have different needs—and even those who have the same needs can have *distinct views* on their *relative importance*.
>
>-- pp 25

- Matching a product with its target customer is like *fishing*. The product is bait and the target customer is fish. You won't know who your customers actually are until you have a product or a prototype to show customers. 
- You define your **target customer** by capturing *all of the relevant customer attributes* that identify someone as being in your target market.
  
- **Market Segmentation**: Dividing a broad market into specific subsets based on attributes.
	- **Demographic Segmentation**:
		- **Demographics** are *quantifiable statistics of a group of people*, such as *age*, *gender*, *marital status*, *income*, and *education level*.
		- If you are targeting businesses, you’ll use **firmographics** which include traits such as *company size* and *industry*.
	- **Psychographic Segmentation**:
		- **Psychographics** are statistics that classify a group of people according to *psychological variables* such as *attitudes*, *opinions*, *values*, and *interests*.
		- Psychographic attributes are more useful than demographics for many products.
	- **Behavioral Segmentation**:
		- You can also use relevant *behavioral attributes* to describe your target customer: whether or not someone takes **a particular action** or how frequently they do.
	- **Needs-Based Segmentation**:
		- You divide the market into customer segments that each have *distinct needs*.
		- Even though they *share* that common *high-level need*, each of these customer segments has different *detailed needs*.
	
- **User vs. Buyer**: 
	- The customers who use our product (**user**) is not the same person who *makes the purchase decision* (**buyer**), esp. for business-to-business product. 
	- It is useful to distinguish **the economic buyer**—the decision-maker who *controls the budget* and writes the check—from the other **stakeholders** involved in the decision-making process.
	- Compared to normal users, buyers would have **distinct needs**. 
	- We should define our **target buyer** in addition to our *target customer* when warranted.

- **Technology Adaption Life Cycle** [^1]: divides a market into five distinct customer segments based on their **risk aversion** towards *adopting new technologies*.
	- **Innovators**: 
		- *technology enthusiasts*
		- familiar with new technology innovations
		- driven by an **intrinsic love of technology**
		- willing to use an *unpolished product* with tradeoffs or shortcomings.
		- accept that many of these products would ultimately fail.
	- **Early Adopters**:
		- *visionaries*
		- want to exploit new innovations to *gain an advantage* over the status quo
		- interest in the **opportunity to gain an edge**.
	- The **Early Majority**:
		- *pragmatists*
		- have no interest in technology *for its own sake*.
		- adopt products **only after a proven** track record of *delivering value*.
		- more **risk averse** than the first two segments,
		- feel more comfortable having **strong references from trusted sources**.
		- tends to buy from the *leading company*.
	- The **Late Majority**:
		- *risk-averse conservatives*
		- *doubtful* that innovations will deliver value
		- only adopt them when **pressured to do so** due to competitions, financial reasons, loss support from the current tech.
	- **Laggards**:
		- *skeptics*
		- be very wary of innovation.
		- hate change 
		- have a *bias* for **criticizing new technologies** even after they have become *mainstream*.
		  
- it is important to understand the **current stage** of your **product market** in the *technology adoption life cycle*.

- **Personas**: The persona is a useful tool for *describing your target customer*.
	- *“personas are not real people”* but rather *“**hypothetical archetypes** of actual users.”*
	- Personas are widely used in UX Design. But it can be used in earlier product design. 
	- Using Personas, the product team would *align* on the same customer. 
	- A good persona empowers everyone on the team with the **same solid foundation of information and reasoning.**
	  
- **Customer Persona**: 
	- covers the following attributes of target customers
		- *Demographic attributes*:
			- Personal Info
			- A **photograph** on the hypothetical stereotype
			- Job Info
			- Demographics
		- *Psychographic attributes*:
			- Relevant *motivations* and attitudes
			- Technology adoption life cycle **segment** (the level of risk aversion towards new tech)
			- **Level** of expertise/knowledge
		- *Behavioral attributes*:
			- Related tasks and behaviors
			- Product usage context/environment
		- *Needs-Based attributes*: 
			- Needs/goals; 
			- **Frustrations/pain points** with current solution
			- **Quote** that conveys what they most care about
	- Personas should fit on a *single page* and provide a **snapshot** of the **customer archetype** that’s quick to digest.
	- The two things on this list that really bring a persona to life are 
		- the **photograph** of the hypothetical person and 
		- the **quote** expressing what’s most important to them.
	- The way to create customer persona:
		- Interview: *“customer discovery” interviews*
		- Survey
			- do not use *averages* of the collected data to populate your persona
		- Hypotheses based on personal experience or judgements
	- **Issues** with Customer Persona:
		- personas can be misused.
		- **weak personas** 
			- lack key information, 
			- be poorly written,
			- be based purely on speculation versus grounded in real customer data.
		- **detailed personas**
			- too many *superfluous details* that don’t add value.
		- developing persona should **not take excessive amount of time**. No need to be perfect.
			- the fidelity of customer personas are improved over time
		- persona may be *ignored* by the rest of product team. 
			- **reference to persona continually**
		- no substitute for **talking to customers** on an ongoing basis.
			- when prototype is ready, we can use it to test who are our true customer
			- when attracted more than one types of customers, create a new persona for each type
