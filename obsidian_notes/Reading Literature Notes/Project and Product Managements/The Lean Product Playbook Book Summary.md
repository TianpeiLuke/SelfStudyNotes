## Book Summary

- This book advocates the **Lean Startup Principles** [^1]  and introduced the ***Lean Product Process***, a set of steps to build *products* that *better fit* the demand of market than their competitors. 

>[!quote]
>I wrote *The Lean Product Playbook* to fill the knowledge gaps faced by many people who want to create a product using Lean Startup principles. This book provides clear, step-by-step guidance to help you build successful products.
>-- *pp xviii, Introduction, Why This Book*

- The motivation of using **Lean Startup Principles** is to understand the reason why product fails.

>[!quote]
>The main reason products fail is because they donâ€™t meet customer needs in a way that is *better than other alternatives*. This is the essence of **product-market fit**.
>-- *pp xvii, Introduction, Why Products Fail*

- The central idea is the **Product-Market Fit Pyramid** as below. It breaks the product-market fit into *five key components*.
	- **Target Customer**:  Who are your product made for?  Who would purchase your product if it were available? 
	- **Underserved Needs**:   What do they want? Are they satisfied with the current solution? 
	- **Value Proposition**:  How can your product fit the demand of your target customer? How is it better than other alternatives? What are the benefits of your product to your customer?
	- **Feature Set**: What characteristics do you product have?
	- **User Experience (UX)**: What is the experience of your customer when using your product?  
	  
- Each above key components is a *hypothesis* that can be tested. 
- The Pyramid shows a logical sequence to these five hypotheses. Only when the lower layer is tested can we move to the upper layer.
