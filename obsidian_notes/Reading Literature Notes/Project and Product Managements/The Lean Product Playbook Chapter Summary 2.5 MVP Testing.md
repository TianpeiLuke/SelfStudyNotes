## Part 2: The Lean Product Process

- The second part covers the six steps of the **Lean Product Process**, where each step is discussed in detail in one chapter (chapters 3 - 9). 
  
>[!important]
> The **Lean Product Process** guides you through the formulation and testing of your hypotheses with these **six steps**: 
> 1. Determine your **target customers** 
> 2. Identify **underserved** *customer needs* 
> 3. Define your **value proposition** 
> 4. Specify your **minimum viable product (MVP)** *feature set* 
> 5. Create your **MVP prototype** 
> 6. **Test** your MVP with *customers*
>

### Create Your MVP Prototype

- **Task**: create a **user experience (UX)** that you can show to customers.
- The goal is to build a **prototype** that lets you **test your hypotheses**.
	- The type of prototype you should create depends on the type of test you want to conduct with customers.
	  
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**:
	- In this book, the author reserves the use of MVP for *actual products*.
	- Many incorrect interpretation on the word *minimum*.
	- While it’s true that an MVP is *deliberately limited in scope* relative to your *entire value proposition*, what you release to customers has to **be above a certain bar** in order to **create value** for them.
	- The diagram in Figure 7.1 below illustrates the **difference** between the *incorrect* and *correct interpretation*.
		- a pyramid of four hierarchical layers is used to describe a product’s attributes:
			- *functional* 
			- *reliable* 
			- **usable**
			- *delightful*

- **MVP Tests**
	- Known as *“Wizard of Oz,”* *“smoke test,”* and *“fake door.”*
	- MVP Test is to show prospective customers functionality and solicit their feedback;
	  
	- Different Dimensions and Types on MVP Tests:
	  
		- **Product v.s. Marketing**
			- **Product MVP Tests**:
				- the goal is **testing your product**
				- the actual product brings the value
			- **Marketing MVP Tests**:
				- the goal is testing your **marketing**
				- the actual value does not come from the actual product.
				- the goal is to validate product-market fit
				  
		- **Quantitative v.s. Qualitative**:
			- **Qualitative**: 
				- talk with customers *directly*, usually in *small numbers* that don’t yield statistical significance. 
				- statistical significance isn’t a primary concern
				- care the **detailed information** from each individual test
			- **Quantitative**:
				- conduct the test *at scale* with *a large number* of customers
				- don’t care as much about any individual result
				- interested in the **aggregate results**
			- Quantitative tests are good for learning *“what”* and *“how many”*
			- Qualitative tests are good for learning *“why”*
			  
		- You must be mindful of what is most important to learn for your situation and choose the type of test accordingly.
			  
		- **Matrix of MVP Tests** (Figure 7.2):
			- **Qualitative Marketing MVP Tests**: 
				- Marketing Materials
			- **Quantitative Marketing MVP Tests**: 
				- **Smoke Test / Landing Page**:
					- One of the most popular tests
					- Create a *live web page* to which you *direct traffic*
					- The **landing page** *describes the product* you plan to build and *asks customers* to express some level of interest via "signup" botton etc.
					- called a **smoke test** because there is *no real product* for customers to use yet.
					- The **key metric** that these tests measure is **the conversion rate**: 
						- the percentage of *visitors* to your landing page that *clicked* on the button to convert from a prospect to a customer.
				- Explainer Video:
					- a variant of the landing page test that relies on a video to explain the product.
				- Ad Compaign:
					- drive traffic to landing page
				- **Marketing A/B Tests**:
					- **A/B testing**, also called **split testing**, is a *quantitative technique* where you test two alternative designs *simultaneously* to *compare* how they perform on a key metric, such as conversion rate.
					- Your tests can have more than two alternatives
					- identify the *best performing option*, which is called the **champion**.
					- An important aspect of this is *statistical significance*, which is determined by the difference in performance and the sample size.
				- *Crowdfunding*:
					- accept money from customers who want to buy the product when it comes out.
					- set a fundraising threshold for your product
			- **Qualitative Product MVP Tests**: 
				- **Wireframes**:
					- a *low to medium fidelity* representation of a product
					- gives a sense of the product’s *components* and how they are *arranged*
					- Wireframes show *relative size* and *position*.
					- *devoid of* any *visual design details* such as colors, images, and fonts
					- A common feature of modern wireframing tools is a *widget library* containing most common user interface elements that you would want to use.
					- add explanatory notes to convey important details
				- **Mockups**:
					- the next level up in fidelity
					- looks much more like the final product than wireframes.
					- convey *visual design details* such as convey visual design details such as colors, fonts, and images
					- Some are intended to be *“pixel perfect”* while others may only represent the approximate size and position of design elements.
					- Mockups are also sometimes referred to as *“comps,”* and are usually created with a graphic design application such as Illustrator, Photoshop, or Sketch.
				- **Interactive Prototype**:
					- The next step up in fidelity and *interactivity*
					- it is either *not a fully functional product* or only a facsimile of a product.
					- provide a level of *interaction* that goes beyond that of just clickable mockups
					- Web prototypes are usually built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
					- Popular **front-end frameworks** such as **jQuery** and **Bootstrap.**
				- **Wizard of Oz** and *concierge MVP*:
					- instead of the final version, you are using *manual workarounds*.
					- be very involved with *a small number* of *early customers*
					- really understand your target market, their needs and preferences, and how to tailor your product to best meet these
				- Live Product
			- **Quantitative Product MVP Tests**: 
				- **Fake Door / 404 Page**:
					- The idea is to include *a link or button for the new feature* and see what percentage of customers click on it.
					- You can also add a form asking the customer to share why they would find this feature valuable.
				- Product Analytics
				- *A/B Tests*:
					- Product A/B tests or split tests are used to *compare* the performance of *two alternative user experiences (A and B)* in your product.
