## Part 2: The Lean Product Process

- The second part covers the six steps of the **Lean Product Process**, where each step is discussed in detail in one chapter (chapters 3 - 9). 
  
>[!important]
> The **Lean Product Process** guides you through the formulation and testing of your hypotheses with these **six steps**: 
> 1. Determine your **target customers** 
> 2. Identify **underserved** *customer needs* 
> 3. Define your **value proposition** 
> 4. Specify your **minimum viable product (MVP)** *feature set* 
> 5. Create your **MVP prototype** 
> 6. **Test** your MVP with *customers*
>

### Test Your MVP with Customers

- This chapter mainly discuss how to conduct **qualitative user testing** of your MVP.
- User feedback is incredibly valuable because it identifies what you don’t know.
- **product blindness**: *blind spots* for the issues that a new user will readily encounter within minutes of using your product.

- **How many customers to test with?**
	- speaking with one customer at a time
	- If you talk to too few, you run the risk of not catching all the issues you need to address.
	- "testing in *waves of five to eight customers at a time* strikes a good balance."
	- some customers will not show up for their user test (about 10 percent)

- **in-person, remote, unmoderated user testing**:
	- **In-person** is straightforward: the moderator and the customer are in the same room. 
	- **Remote testing** is possible using screen sharing or video recording technology.
	- **Unmoderated** implies that no moderator is present; instead, customers are provided with the artifact or product to test and guidance on what to do.
	- the author recommend **in-person** if possible.
	- If in-person is difficult, you can still get valuable information via remote testing.
	- since you are not present to guide users, you have to put more thought into structuring the flow of the test and the directions you give the user.

- **How to recruit customers in target market?**
	- Demographic attributes
	- Behavioral attributes
	- Psychographic attributes
	- Refer to the **personas** you created for your target market to develop screener questions

- **How to Avoid the Scheduling Trap?**

- **Compensating Customers**

- **How to Structure the User Test?**
	- Prepare a *test script* that lists what you *plan* to show and ask the user.
		- design artifacts or parts of the product to show
		- tasks to accomplish, 
		- questions to ask
	- Maybe conduct *a pilot test* with a team member
	- User tests typically run about an hour plus or minus 15 minutes
	- *Start* the user test off on the *right foot*.
		- spend a minute or two chit-chatting, making them feel comfortable
		- compensating them for their time
		- tell users up front that you want their honest feedback, even if it’s negative
	- During the test, let the user *verbalize his or her thoughts* so you can hear them
		- To help ensure you receive enough feedback, it’s a good idea to explicitly encourage the user to share thoughts out loud as they occur (i.e., stream of consciousness) throughout the user test. 
		- This is called the **think aloud protocol**.

- **How to Ask Good Questions?**
	- *Discovery questions* are great for exploring the problem space and your value proposition with customers.
	- The goals are
		- understand 
			- the customers’ needs, 
			- their current solution, 
			- what they like and don’t like about it, and 
			- how satisfied they are.
		- try to validate your hypotheses about your target customer and your value proposition.
	- Ask about their *current behavior* and *feelings* about the key benefit you plan to provide
	- After discovery, you transition to the *product feedback* portion of the user test.
		- the point is to get *objective feedback* from real customers
		- The best moderators engage the user with the product with *as little intervention as possible.*
	- Let user ask the moderator questions during the test.
	- **Ask Open Questions**:
		- Asking open versus closed questions is less a matter of moderator bias and has more to do with the moderator’s *skill level*.
		- get in the habit of saying your next question in your mind before you verbalize it
		- *Avoid embedding* a *preferred or possible answer* in your question.
		- **Intervene** in the test **as little as possible**.
	- Show less empathy for customer's pain points
		- Your goal is to keep the test *as real as possible*
		- act as though you were a fly on the wall and not break character during the feedback portion
		- refrain from explaining confusing text or UI to them, telling them what to click on, or grabbing their mouse and doing it for them
		- do not argue or get defensive

- **Usability versus Product-Market Fit**
	- differentiate between feedback on usability versus product-market fit
	- **Usability Feedback**: how *easy* it is for customers to understand and use your product
	- **Product-Market Fit**: how *valuable* they find your product
	- *Poor usability (e.g. poor UX design)* often prevents users from seeing the *full value* your product provides
	- As the usability improves, you can get a more accurate read of product-market fit
	- **Great usability does not mean strong product-market fit.** The latter still need to infer directly from target customers.
	- If your user tests are showing that you don’t have product-market fit once you get *past any major usability issues*, you might need to
		- *revisit your hypotheses* about your value proposition, MVP, or UX design.
		- *revisit your hypotheses* about your target customer

### Iterate and Pivot to Improve Product-Market Fit

- **The Build-Measure-Learn Loop** [^1]
	- **Build**: 
		- means having something that you can test with customers
		- The goal is to *identify and create* what will let you test your hypotheses while consuming *the least resources.*
	- **Measure**:
		- doesn’t have to be as quantitative as it sounds.
		- A/B testing is not the only way to test hypotheses or gain learning
		- The key point is that you are *testing your hypotheses* with customers.
	- **Learn**:
		- two things going on in this step
			- *learning new things* from the results of each test
			- use what you learn to *modify the hypotheses* that led to the test you just ran
		- whole process doesn’t start with “build”—it starts with some initial hypotheses

- **The Hypothesize-Design-Test-Learn Loop**: [^2]  you test and improve your *problem space thinking* by showing customers a product or design artifact in the *solution space* and soliciting their feedback on it.
	- **Hypothesize**: formulate your *problem space hypotheses*.
	- **Design**: *identify* the best way to test your hypotheses
		- Creating a *design artifact or product* based on your hypotheses takes us from the problem space to the solution space
	- **Test**: *expose* your product or artifact *to customers* and make *observations*
	- **Learn**: validate hypothesis and learn
	- **Complete the loop** by using this validated learning to *revise and improve* your hypotheses.

- **Perserve or Pivot?**
	- There is no guarantee iterative user testing alone would lead to product-market fit. 
	- If you find that you are not making progress as you try to iterate, I recommend you **pause** and **take a step back**.
	- When you *change* one of your *main hypotheses*, it’s called a **pivot**.
	- A pivot means a *significant change in direction.*
	- One of the **hardest parts** of *the Lean Product Process* can be deciding whether to **persevere** with the opportunity you are pursuing, **pivot** to a new opportunity, or **stop** altogether.
		- If you don’t achieve product-market fit or make significant progress toward that goal, it can be challenging to raise the next round of investment.
		- if you still have cash in the bank and time on the clock, consider pivoting if you just don’t seem to be achieving gains in product-market fit *after several rounds of trying* to iterate.
	- Sometimes the best way to pivot becomes relatively clear from your tests.
