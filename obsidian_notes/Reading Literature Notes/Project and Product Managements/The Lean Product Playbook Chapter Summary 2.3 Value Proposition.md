## Part 2: The Lean Product Process

- The second part covers the six steps of the **Lean Product Process**, where each step is discussed in detail in one chapter (chapters 3 - 9). 
  
>[!important]
> The **Lean Product Process** guides you through the formulation and testing of your hypotheses with these **six steps**: 
> 1. Determine your **target customers** 
> 2. Identify **underserved** *customer needs* 
> 3. Define your **value proposition** 
> 4. Specify your **minimum viable product (MVP)** *feature set* 
> 5. Create your **MVP prototype** 
> 6. **Test** your MVP with *customers*
>

### Define Your Value Proposition

- **Task**: decide which important customer needs our product will address.
- A good product is designed with **focus on the set of needs that are important** and that make sense to *address together*.
- Limits the risk wasting resources with an initial product scope that is too large.
	- Start off by identifying **the minimum viable product (MVP)**.
	- Test MVP with customer
	- Revisit your hypotheses about the relevant needs to address if the assumption were wrong

- **Product Value Proposition**: 
	- *identifies* the **specific customer needs** our product will **address**
	- *articulates* how it is **better** and **different than the alternatives**.
	- also decides what are the *other* customer benefits our product **won’t address**.

>[!quote]
>One of the best definitions I’ve heard of **strategy** is: “deciding what you’re not going to do.”
>-- *pp 68, STRATEGY MEANS SAYING “NO”*

- Selecting the *Customer Needs* via **the Kano model**
	- address **must-haves**, **performance** and **delighter** *needs* separately. 
	- list the **must-haves**, since they are **required**.
		- the must-haves will likely be the same with *competitors* and there will probably be significant *overlap* among the performance benefits.
	- the **performance benefits** are the **core** of *value proposition*.
		- you choose to *compete* on the performance benefits
	- the **delighters** are unique benefits 


TABLE 1  *Product Value Proposition Template*

|                           | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Our Product |
| ------------------------- | ------------| -------------| -------------|
| **Must-have Benefits**    |             |              |              |
|    Must-have 1            |             |              |              |
|    Must-have 2            |             |              |              |
| **Performance Benefits**  |             |              |              |
|    Performance benefit 1  |             |              |              |
|    Performance benefit 2  |             |              |              |
| **Delighter Benefits**    |             |              |              |
|    Delighter 1            |             |              |              |
|    Delighter 2            |             |              |              |

- Table above is a blank template for our *value proposition*.
	- In the first column, we **list the benefits**—one per row, **grouped by type**.
	- include the **relevant** *must-haves*, *performance benefits*, and *delighters* for both our product and our competitors.
	- have a column for each relevant competitor and a column for our product.
- When fill in the template:
	- If you are assessing an *existing product*, you can **score** it; 
	- if you are building a *new product*, you can list the scores you **plan to achieve**.
	- *must-haves*: should be “Yes.” 
	- *performance benefits*: use whatever *scale* works best for you: 
		- A scale of “High,” “Medium,” and “Low” usually works well.
	- *delighters*: usually *unique*; mark “Yes” where applicable.


>[!quote]
>To be strategic, you want to ensure that you are **projecting forward in time**, **anticipating the important trends** in your market and **what competitors are likely to do**. This is especially important in many high-tech markets, which often have a rapid pace of change. As Wayne Gretzky said, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it’s been.”

- Predict **Future** with Value Proposition:
	- use separate columns for **“now”** and **“later”** for each competitor and your product
	- do not just solve for current market conditions, think of the future
	- reduce the risk of heading toward a path that becomes sub-optimal in the future.
