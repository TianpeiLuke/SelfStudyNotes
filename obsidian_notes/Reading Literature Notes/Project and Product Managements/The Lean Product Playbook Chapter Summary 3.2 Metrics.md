## Part 3: Building and Optimizing Your Product

### Measure Your Key Metrics

#### A Framework for Learning Methods from Christian Rohrer

- **Vertical axis**: 
	- *the type of information* you are collecting: attitudinal or behavioral.
		- **Attitudinal** information: what customers *say* about their attitudes and opinions.
		- **Behavioral** information: what customers *actually do.*
	  
- **Horizontal axis**:  
	- the *approach* for collecting the information, which is either qualitative or quantitative.
		- **Quantitative** research can tell you *how many* customers are doing (or not doing) something.
		- **Qualitative** research will help you get at the *underlying reasons* for why customers do what they do.

- **User Interviews**
	- **qualitative** and **attitudinal**
	- In these interviews, we attempt to understand a user’s needs and preferences. You want to determine how they think about the problem and the relevant context.
	- not try to observe any behavior.
	- ask open-ended questions
	- mainly listen to the thoughts and attitudes of customer
	  
- **Usablity Testing**
	- **qualitative** and **behavioral**
	- *qualitative*: paying attention to what each user has to say
	- usability test concerned with *behavior*. 
	- Instead of having a user tell you if they would or wouldn’t take a certain action in your product (attitudinal), you want to **see if they actually do or don’t** (behavioral).
	- The main goal is to gain *behavioral learning* by observing the customer use your **prototype** or your **product**. 
	- Conducting usability tests on a *competitor’s product* can also yield valuable insights.
	  
- **Surveys**
	- **quantitative** and **attitudinal**
	- the *goal* is to obtain results from a large number of users to see the overall results  
	- **attitudinal**: customers are telling you what they think; you are not capturing behavioral data of them using your product.
	  
- **Analytics and A/B Testing**
	- **quantitative** and **behavioral**
	- Analytics allow you to measure *real customer behavior*
		- don’t have to worry about any *disconnect* between what customers *say they will do* and what they *actually do*.
	- A/B testing allows you to send a portion of your customer traffic to the new version and the rest to the old version, while tracking the results for each.

#### AARRR Analytics Framework

>[!important]
> - **Acquisition**: How many prospects (new visitors) are our marketing programs driving to our website?
> - **Conversion**: What percentage of prospects that come to our website sign up as customers? 
> - **Retention**: What percentage of our customers remain active over time? 
> - **Revenue**: How much money do our customers generate?

#### Identify the Metric That Matters Most

- **“metric that matters most”**:  **MTMM**
- Our *MTMM* is the metric that offers the **highest ROI opportunity** for improving our business **right now**—and the “right now” is an important aspect.


#### The Equations of Business

1. $$
Profit = Revenue − Cost
$$
2. $$Revenue = Users \times Average\ Revenue\ per\ User
$$
3. 
$$Revenue = Visitors \times Average\ Revenue\ per\ Visitor $$

4. The cost of the ads is specified in units of “**CPM,**” or **cost per thousand impressions**
$$
Average\ Revenue\ per\ Visitor = Impressions\ per\ Visitor \times Effective\ CPM / 1,000
$$

5. 
$$Visitors = New\ Visitors + Returning\ Visitors$$

6. 
$$
{Returning\ Visitors}_T = Visitors_{T−1} \times Return\ Rate
$$

7. 
$$
Return\ Rate = \frac{{Returning\ Visitors}_T}{Visitors_{T−1}}
$$
8. 
$$Profit = Revenue − Cost$$
9. 
$$Revenue = Paying\ Users \times Average\ Revenue\ per\ Paying\ User$$

$$
Paying\ Users = New\ Paying\ Users + Repeat\ Paying\ Users
$$

$$
{Repeat\ Paying\ Users}_T = {Paying\ Users}_{T−1} \times (1 − Cancellation Rate)
$$

$$
New\ Paying\ Users = Free\ Trial\ Users \times Trial\ Conversion\ Rate + Direct\ Paid\ Signups
$$

10. 
$$
Profit = Number\ of\ Customers \times Profit\ per\ Customer
$$

$$
Profit\ per\ Customer = Revenue\ per\ Customer − Cost\ per\ Customer
$$

$$
Profit\ per\ Customer = Customer\ Lifetime\ Value − Customer\ Acquisition\ Cost
$$

11. **Customer lifetime value (LTV)** is the profit that a customer generates for you *without taking into account the cost to acquire the customer*.

$$
LTV = ARPU \times Average\ Customer\ Lifetime \times Gross\ Margin
$$

$$
Average\ Customer\ Lifetime = \frac{1}{Churn\ Rate}
$$

$$
LTV = \frac{ARPU \times Gross\ Margin  }{Churn\ Rate}
$$

12. **customer acquisition cost (CAC)**, which you can calculate if you know the number of new customers you added in a given time period and your sales and marketing costs for the same time period:

$$
CAC = \frac{Sales\ and\ Marketing\ Costs}{New\ Customers\ Added}
$$

$$
CAC = \frac{Cost\ per\ Acquisition}{Prospect\ Conversion\ Rate}
$$
- The **cost per acquisition** (often shortened to **CPA**) is how much it costs on average for each prospect.
