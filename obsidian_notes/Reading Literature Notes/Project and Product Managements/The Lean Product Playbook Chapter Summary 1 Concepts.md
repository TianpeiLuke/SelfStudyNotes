## Part 1: Core Concepts

- This part covers two main concepts:
	- **Product-Market Fit** (chapter 1)
	- **Problem Space v.s. Solution Space** (chapter 2)

### Product-Market Fit

- **Product-Market Fit**:
	- Product-market fit is one of the most important **Lean Startup** ideas.
	- Product-market fit means that the product *meets the need* of target customer and does it *better than alternatives* in the market.
	- It means that *you have built a product that creates significant **customer value**.*
	  
 >[!quote]
 >Product-market fit means *being in a good market* with a product that can *satisfy* that market.

>[!quote]
>In business, there is a distinction between **creating value** and **capturing value**. In order to capture value, you must first create it.

>-- pp 5, *WHAT IS PRODUCT-MARKET FIT?*

- **Product-Market Fit Pyramid**
	- A *hierarchical* model decomposes product-market into its *five key components*, each a layer of the pyramid.
	  
	- **Market**: 
		- A *market* consists of all the existing and potential *customers* that **share a particular customer need** or **set of related needs**.
		- Market can be measured in order of *the total customer size* or *total revenue* generated by these customers. 
		  
		- Customer would choose different solutions. Markets can be divided into different sectors. 
		- Within a given market, we can analyze the **market share** of each *competing product* —that is, what percentage of the market each product has.
		  
		- The *Product-Market Fit Pyramid* separates the market into its **two distinct components**: 
			- the **target customers**: defines the scope and relevancy;  
			- the **needs of the target customer**. 
		- Note that only the needs of *target customer* that are *relevant* to achieving product-market fit.
		   
	- **Product**:
		- A *product* is a specific offering ***intended to*** **meet a set of customer needs**.
		- Product can be manufactured goods or services. 
		- We can view the three layers of Pyramid that defines the product from top to down, 
			- **User Experience (UX)**:  The UX is what *brings a product’s **functionality to life*** **for the user**.
			- **Feature Set**: A set of features that defines the **functionality** of product.
			- **Value Proposition**:  The set of **needs** that you *aspire to* **meet** with **your product** forms your *value proposition*.
				- Identify the ***specific customer needs*** your product should *address.*
				- Determine ***how*** your product will be ***better*** than the *others in the market.*
				- Value Proposition is a part of the **Product Strategy**.
			  
		- From top down, we begins with what customer really sees and uses (*UX*) to the system that support them (*Feature Set*), then to the design that identifies what customer needs to address. This is the idea of **working backward** from customer. [^2]
		  
	- **Product-Market Fit**:
		- Under this mode, the product-market fit can be measured by *how well your **product** (**UX**, **Feature Set**, **Value Propositions**) satisfies the **market** (defined via your **target customers** and **their needs**).* 
		  
		- The key: Your **target customers** *determine* how well your product *fits* their needs.

>To achieve product-market fit, your product should *meet* ***underserved needs better*** than the *competition*.
>-- pp 7, *Your Product*

- **Lean Product Process**: [[The Lean Product Playbook Chapter Summary 2.1 Target Customer]]
	- Not all six steps are required for every product or feature. Certain steps are required only when you’re building a *completely new product*.
	  
	- In a sense, the process is a *checklist* to help make sure you’ve thought about the **key assumptions** and **decisions to be made** when creating a product.
	  
	- We can follow these steps implicitly but **do not skip the process**. Otherwise, we run into risks of leaving important assumptions (target customers, product strategies) untested.  
	  
	- Lean Product Process is not a *linear process*. We will have some reworks on the process. 
	  
	- The *goal* of the process is to achieve product-market fit **as quickly as possible**.

### Problem Space v.s. Solution Space

- Another important concept: **Separating Problem Space from Solution Space.**

- **Solution Space**: includes any *product or representation of a product* that is used by or intended for use by a customer.
- **Problem Space**: where all the *customer needs* that you’d like *your product to deliver* live.
	- Whether it’s a customer *pain point*, *a desire*, *a job to be done*, or *a user story*, it lives in problem space.

- There is a risk of *jumping into the solution space* **prematurely** and we will see the advantage of **starting in the problem space**.

- The key message in this chapter is **Problems Define Markets**. This is an **outside-in** approach, which is in contrasts to the *"inside-out"* approach that focus on solution before identifying the problem. 
	- A clear **problem-space thinking**: Begin with "*having a more accurate understanding* of the **market** in which your product is really *competing*."
	- An *"outside-in" approach* starts with an understanding of the **customer’s problem space**. 
	- "A market is *not tied to any specific solutions* that meet those needs."
	- In **problem-space thinking**, we focus on **what** instead of **how**. 
		- **"What"** describes the *benefits* that the product should give the customer
		- **"How"** is the *design* of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product.
		  
>[!important]
>**Lean** product teams *articulate the hypotheses* they have made and *solicit customer feedback* on **early design ideas** to test those hypotheses. This approach is the **essence of Lean**.

- **Listen to Customer?** 
	- Point 1: talking with users will not lead you to come up with *new, breakthrough solutions*.
		- Argument 1: knowing customer needs help to explore new potential solutions, and to estimate the value of each solution. 
		  
	- Point 2: customers are *not likely to tell exactly what they need*, esp. in abstract term. When they do, their answer may *not be accurate*. 
		- Argument 2: It’s **the product team’s job** to unearth these needs and *define the problem space*. They can achieve this with 
			- Interviews. It is often called **“contextual inquiry”** or **“customer discovery.”**
			- "The reality is that customers are much better at giving you feedback *in the solution space.*"
			- Use *solution space* to **discover** the **problem space**.


>[!quote]
>It’s likely true that customers won’t invent a breakthrough product for you; but that doesn’t mean it’s a waste of time to understand their needs and preferences. On the contrary, a good understanding of customer needs and preferences helps product teams **explore new potential solutions** and **estimate how valuable** customers are likely to find each one to be.

>[!quote]
>The best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created.

>-- *pp 21, USING THE SOLUTION SPACE TO DISCOVER THE PROBLEM SPACE*

- Problem space and solution space are an **integral part** of the Product-Market Fit Pyramid.
	- *Feature Set and UX* of Product live in **solution space**.
	- ***Value Proposition**, Underserved Needs, and Target Customer* live in **problem space**.
	- The important interface between problem space and solution space occurs *between your **value proposition** and your **feature set***.
	- **Value proposition** is the *problem space layer* over which you have **the most control**.



>[!quote]
>"Customers don’t care about your solution. They care about their problems." **Keeping problem space and solution space separate** and **alternating** between them as you **iteratively test and improve your hypotheses** is the best way to achieve product-market fit.
