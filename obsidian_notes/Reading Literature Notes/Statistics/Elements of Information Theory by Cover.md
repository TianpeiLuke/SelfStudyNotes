> [!Abstract]  
> The latest edition of this classic is updated with new problem sets and material
> 
> The Second Edition of this fundamental textbook maintains the book's tradition of clear, thought-provoking instruction. Readers are provided once again with an instructive mix of mathematics, physics, statistics, and information theory.
> 
> All the essential topics in information theory are covered in detail, including entropy, data compression, channel capacity, rate distortion, network information theory, and hypothesis testing. The authors provide readers with a solid understanding of the underlying theory and applications. Problem sets and a telegraphic summary at the end of each chapter further assist readers. The historical notes that follow each chapter recap the main points.
> 
> The Second Edition features:
> - Chapters reorganized to improve teaching
> - 200 new problems
> - New material on source coding, portfolio theory, and feedback capacity
> - Updated references
> 
> Now current and enhanced, the Second Edition of Elements of Information Theory remains the ideal textbook for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in electrical engineering, statistics, and telecommunications.
