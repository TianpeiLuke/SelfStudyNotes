## AWS Step Functions State Machines

- **Core Purpose:** A serverless workflow orchestration service that allows you to build distributed applications using **state machines**. It's a general-purpose orchestrator for any kind of distributed application, not just ML.
    
- **Abstraction Level:** Lower-level, highly flexible. You define your workflow as a sequence of "states" (tasks, choices, parallels, waits, etc.) in JSON (Amazon States Language) or by using SDKs (like the AWS Step Functions Data Science SDK). Each state can invoke almost any AWS service API.
    
- **Integration:** Extremely broad integration with over 200 AWS services (Lambda, EC2, ECS, Glue, EMR, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, IoT, and more). This means you can build workflows that combine ML steps with data ingestion, ETL, data warehousing, custom compute, notifications, and other business logic.
    
- **Control:** Offers fine-grained control over workflow logic, error handling, retries, parallel execution, and human approval steps. You have direct control over the state machine definition.
    
- **Visibility:** Provides a visual workflow editor (Workflow Studio) in the AWS console for designing and monitoring state machine executions. Detailed execution history is available.
    
- **Typical Use Cases:**
    - Complex, multi-service workflows involving ETL, data processing, and ML.
    - Workflows that require interaction with services outside the immediate SageMaker ecosystem.
    - Orchestrating long-running tasks or those with complex branching/looping logic.
    - Building custom MLOps pipelines from scratch, integrating various AWS services.
    - Serverless applications with sequential or parallel processing steps.

## Amazon SageMaker Pipelines

- **Core Purpose:** A purpose-built, fully managed **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) service for machine learning** workflows within the Amazon SageMaker ecosystem.
	- [[Continuous Integration or CI in DevOps and MLOps]]
- **Abstraction Level:** Higher-level, ML-centric. 
	- It provides specific "steps" that directly map to common SageMaker MLOps operations 
	- (e.g., `ProcessingStep`, `TrainingStep`, `RegisterModelStep`, `CreateModelStep`). 
	- It simplifies the process of building ML pipelines.
    
- **Integration:** Primarily integrated with SageMaker services (Training Jobs, Processing Jobs, Model Registry, Model Endpoints, Experiments, Lineage). While you can use `LambdaStep` to extend its functionality to other AWS services, its core design focuses on SageMaker-specific ML tasks.
- **Control:** Offers a streamlined API for defining ML workflows, automatically managing dependencies between SageMaker jobs. It handles much of the underlying Step Functions complexity for you.
- **Visibility:** Integrates seamlessly with SageMaker Studio, providing a visual graph of your pipeline, tracking experiments, model lineage, and direct access to job logs and artifacts within the Studio environment.
- **Typical Use Cases:**
    - Automating the end-to-end ML lifecycle (data preparation, model training, evaluation, model registration, model deployment) within SageMaker.
    - Implementing MLOps best practices like CI/CD for ML models, versioning models in the Model Registry.
        
    - Teams primarily working within SageMaker Studio and leveraging its integrated MLOps capabilities.
    - Streamlining repetitive ML tasks for training and deploying models.

## Key Distinction: Abstraction and Scope

>[!important]
> The fundamental difference lies in their **level of abstraction** and **scope**:
> 
> - **Step Functions:** Is a **generic workflow orchestrator**. 
> 	- You have to define every *low-level API call* and *state transition*. 
> 	- It's powerful and flexible for _any_ distributed application, but requires more manual setup for ML-specific logic.
>     
> - **SageMaker Pipelines:** Is an **ML-specific workflow orchestrator** built _on top_ of Step Functions. 
> 	- It *abstracts* away much of the underlying Step Functions complexity and provides pre-built, high-level steps tailored for *common ML operations* within SageMaker. 
> 	- This makes it easier for ML practitioners to build CI/CD for models, 
> 	- but it's *less flexible* for orchestrating workflows that extensively involve non-SageMaker AWS services without additional bridging (`LambdaStep`).


> [!info]
> **In essence:**
> 
> - If your workflow is **ML-heavy and largely stays within the SageMaker ecosystem**, **SageMaker Pipelines** provides a more streamlined, higher-level, and integrated experience.
> - If your workflow is **complex, involves many different AWS services beyond SageMaker, or requires very fine-grained control over the orchestration logic**, **AWS Step Functions** offers the ultimate flexibility.
