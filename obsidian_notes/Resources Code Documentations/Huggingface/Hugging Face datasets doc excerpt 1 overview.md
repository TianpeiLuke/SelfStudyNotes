# About Package

>[!quote]
>**Datasets** is a library for easily accessing and sharing datasets for Audio, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
>
> Load a dataset in a single line of code, and use our powerful data processing methods to quickly get your dataset ready for training in a deep learning model. Backed by the Apache Arrow format, process large datasets with zero-copy reads without any memory constraints for optimal speed and efficiency. We also feature a deep integration with the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets), allowing you to easily load and share a dataset with the wider machine learning community.
