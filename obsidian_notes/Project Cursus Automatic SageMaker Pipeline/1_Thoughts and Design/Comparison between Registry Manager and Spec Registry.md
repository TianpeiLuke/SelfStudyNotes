Great question! Let me clarify the relationship between `SpecificationRegistry` and `RegistryManager` - they're actually **complementary, not redundant**.

## The Two-Layer Architecture

**SpecificationRegistry** (Individual Registry):
- **Single-context storage**: Manages specifications for ONE specific context (e.g., one pipeline)
- **Core functionality**: Registration, retrieval, compatibility matching for steps within that context
- **Scope**: Limited to a specific pipeline/environment

**RegistryManager** (Registry Coordinator):
- **Multi-context orchestration**: Manages MULTIPLE `SpecificationRegistry` instances
- **Context isolation**: Ensures complete separation between different pipelines/environments
- **Lifecycle management**: Creates, retrieves, clears registries for different contexts

## Why Both Are Needed

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
```python
# SpecificationRegistry: Handles the "what" - step specifications within a context
registry = SpecificationRegistry("my-pipeline")
registry.register("data_step", spec)
registry.find_compatible_outputs(dependency)

# RegistryManager: Handles the "where" - which registry for which context
manager = RegistryManager()
pipeline_a_registry = manager.get_registry("pipeline-a")
pipeline_b_registry = manager.get_registry("pipeline-b")
```

### 2. **Context Isolation**
Without `RegistryManager`, you'd have:
- **Global pollution**: All specifications mixed together
- **Naming conflicts**: Steps from different pipelines could interfere
- **No environment separation**: Dev/staging/prod would share the same registry

With `RegistryManager`:
- **Clean isolation**: Each pipeline gets its own specification namespace
- **Environment safety**: `manager.get_registry("prod-pipeline")` vs `manager.get_registry("dev-pipeline")`
- **Easy cleanup**: `manager.clear_context("old-pipeline")`

### 3. **Scalability Pattern**
```python
# Without RegistryManager - doesn't scale
global_registry = SpecificationRegistry()  # Everything mixed together

# With RegistryManager - scales to many pipelines
manager = RegistryManager()
for pipeline_name in ["pipeline-a", "pipeline-b", "pipeline-c"]:
    registry = manager.get_registry(pipeline_name)
    # Each pipeline has isolated specifications
```

## Real-World Usage Pattern

```python
# 1. RegistryManager creates/retrieves context-specific registries
manager = RegistryManager()
pipeline_registry = manager.get_registry("fraud-detection-pipeline")

# 2. SpecificationRegistry handles step management within that context
pipeline_registry.register("data_loading", data_spec)
pipeline_registry.register("feature_engineering", feature_spec)
pipeline_registry.register("model_training", training_spec)

# 3. Dependency resolver works within the context
resolver = UnifiedDependencyResolver(pipeline_registry, semantic_matcher)
resolved_deps = resolver.resolve_all_dependencies(["data_loading", "feature_engineering", "model_training"])
```

## Alternative Design Consideration

You could theoretically have a **single-layer design** where `SpecificationRegistry` handles contexts internally:

```python
# Hypothetical single-layer approach
registry = SpecificationRegistry()
registry.register("pipeline-a", "data_step", spec)
registry.register("pipeline-b", "data_step", spec)  # Different spec, same step name
```

**But this would be problematic because:**
- **Violates single responsibility**: Registry would handle both storage AND context management
- **Complex API**: Every method would need context parameters
- **Harder testing**: Can't test registry logic independently of context management
- **Less flexible**: Harder to extend with features like registry migration, backup/restore per context

## Conclusion

The two-layer design follows the **composition pattern**:
- `SpecificationRegistry` = **Core functionality** (step management)
- `RegistryManager` = **Orchestration layer** (context management)

This is similar to how databases work:
- **Database** = stores and queries data (like SpecificationRegistry)
- **Database Manager** = manages multiple databases, connections, isolation (like RegistryManager)

So no, it's not redundant - it's a well-architected separation that provides both functionality and scalability while maintaining clean boundaries between concerns.
