\section{Paradigms and Principles}
\subsection{Inside-Out}
If we wanted to change the situation, we first had to \emph{\textbf{change ourselves}}. And to change ourselves effectively, we first had to change our \emph{\textbf{perceptions}}.
\subsubsection{Peronality and Character Ethics}
\begin{itemize}
\item The elements of \emph{\textbf{Personality Ethic}} are sometimes essential for success.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{personality growth}
\item \emph{communication skills}
\item eduation in \emph{the field of influcence strategies}
\item \emph{positive thinking}
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Primary and Secondary Greatness}
\begin{itemize}
\item The elements of \emph{\textbf{Personality Ethic}} are \emph{\textbf{secondary}}, not primary traits. If my \emph{\textbf{character}} is fundamentally flawed, marked by duplicity and insincerity, then, in the long run, I cannot be successful -- My duplicity will breed \emph{distrust}, and everything i do -- even using so-called good human relations techniques -- will be preceived as \emph{manipulative}. 
\item In \emph{\textbf{one-shot} or \textbf{short-term}} human interactions, you can use Personality Ethics to win over good impressions through charm and skill.
\item If there is little or no trust, there is no foundation for permanent success. Only \emph{\textbf{basic goodness}} gives life to techinque.
\item You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut.
\item If there isn't \emph{\textbf{deep integrity}} and \emph{\textbf{fundamental character strength}}, the challenges of life will cause true motives to surface and human relationship failure will replace short-term success.
\item Many people with secondary greatness -- that is, social recognition for their talents -- lack primary greatness or goodness in their character.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Power of A Paradigm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People} embody many of the fundamental principles of human effectiveness. These habits are basic; they are primary. They represent \emph{the \textbf{internalization} of \textbf{correct principles} upon which enduring happiness and success are based}.

\item The word \emph{\textbf{paradigm}} is more commonly used today to mean a model, theory, perception, assumption, or frame of reference. In a more general sense, it means the way we \emph{\textbf{see}} the world in terms of \emph{preceiving}, \emph{understanding}, \emph{interpreting}.

\item A simple way to understand \emph{paradigms} is to see them as \emph{\textbf{maps}}. \emph{\textbf{Maps is not the territory}}. A map is simply an explanation of certain aspects of the territory. It is a theory, an explanation, or model of something else.

\item Each of us has many, many maps in our head, which can be divided into two main categories: 
\begin{itemize}
\item maps of the way things \emph{are}, or \emph{\textbf{realities}}, 
\item and maps of the way things \emph{should be}, or \emph{\textbf{values}}.
\end{itemize} 

\item We seldom question their accuracy; we're usually even unaware that we have them. We simply assume that the way we see things is the way
they really are or the way they should be. 

\item And our \emph{\textbf{attitudes}} and \emph{\textbf{behaviors}} grow out of those assumptions. The way we see things is the source of the way we think and the way we act.


\item The fundamental problem has nothing to do with your \emph{behavior} or your \emph{attitude}. It has everything to do with \emph{having a wrong map}.

\item The paradigms are the source of our attitudes and behaviors. And \emph{\textbf{conditioning effects}} impact our perceptions and paradigms. 

\item The basic \emph{\textbf{flaws}} of \emph{the personality ethic} is oo try to change \emph{outward attitudes and behaviors} does very little good in the long run if we fail to \emph{examine \textbf{the basic paradigms}} from which those attitudes and behaviors flow.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Power of A Paradigm Shift}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Paradigm Shift}}: almost every significant breakthrough in the field of scientific endeavor is first a break with \emph{tradition}, with \emph{old ways of thinking}, with \emph{old paradigms}.

\item Not all Paradigm Shifts are in positive directions. As we have observed, the shift from \emph{the character ethic} to \emph{the personality ethic} has drawn us away from the very roots that nourish true success and happiness.

\item But whether they shift us in positive or negative directions, paradigm shift create powerful change. Our paradigms, correct or incorrect, are the sources of our attitudes and behaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others.

\item Many people experience a similar fundamental shift in thinking when they face a life-threatening crisis and suddenly see their priorities in a different light, or when they suddenly step into a new role, such as that of husband or wife, parent or grandparent, manager or leader.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Seeing and Being}
\begin{itemize}
\item Not all Paradigm Shifts are \emph{instantaneous}. The power of a Paradigm Shift is the essential power of \emph{\textbf{quantum change}}, whether that shift is an instantaneous or a slow and deliberate process

\item Our Paradigms are the way we ``\emph{see}" the world or circumstances -- not in terms of our visual sense of sight, but in terms of \emph{\textbf{perceiving}, \textbf{understanding}, and \textbf{interpreting}}. 

\item \emph{\textbf{Paradigms}} are inseparable from \emph{\textbf{character}}. \emph{\textbf{Being}} is \emph{\textbf{seeing}} in the \emph{human dimension}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Principle-Centered Paradigm}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{\textbf{Character Ethic}} is based on the fundamental idea that \emph{there are \textbf{principles} that govern human \textbf{effectiveness}} -- natural laws in the human dimension that are just as real, just as \emph{unchanging and unarguably ``there"} as laws such as gravity are in the physical dimension.

\item Principles are like lighthouses. They are natural laws that cannot be broken. 

\item \emph{\textbf{Principles} are not \textbf{values}}. Principles are the \emph{territory}. Values are \emph{maps}. When we value correct principles, we have \emph{truth} -- a knowledge of things as they are.

\item Principles are \emph{guidelines} for human conduct that are proven to have \emph{enduring}, \emph{permanent value}. They're \emph{fundamental}. They're essentially unarguable because they are \emph{\textbf{self-evident}}. 

\item The more closely our \emph{\textbf{maps or paradigms}} \emph{are \textbf{aligned} with} these \emph{\textbf{principles}} or natural laws, the more accurate and functional they will be. Correct maps will infinitely impact our \emph{personal and interpersonal effectiveness} far more than any amount of effort expended on changing our attitudes and
behaviors
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Principles of Growth and Change}
\begin{itemize}
\item In all of life, there are \emph{\textbf{sequential} stages} of \emph{growth} and \emph{development}. Each step is important and each one takes time. No step
can be skipped.

\item This is true in all phases of life, in all areas of development.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Way we See the Problem Is the Problem}
\begin{itemize}
\item The way we see the problem is the problem.

\item Can you see how fundamentally the paradigms of the personality ethic affect the very way we see our problems as well as the way we attempt to solve them?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{A New Level of Thinking}
\begin{itemize}
\item This new level of thinking is what \emph{Seven Habits of Highly Effective People} is about.

\item It's a \emph{\textbf{principle-centered}, \textbf{character-based}, ``\textbf{Inside-Out}" approach} to \emph{\textbf{personal} and \textbf{interpersonal effectiveness}}.

\item ``\emph{\textbf{Inside-Out}}" means to \emph{start first with \textbf{self}}; even more fundamentally, to start with the most \emph{\textbf{inside part of self}} -- with your \emph{\textbf{paradigms}}, your \emph{\textbf{character}}, and your \emph{\textbf{motives}}.

\item The Inside-Out approach says that \emph{Private Victories} precede \emph{Public Victories}, that making
and keeping promises to \emph{ourselves} precedes making and keeping promises to \emph{others}.

\item Inside-Out is a \emph{\textbf{process}} -- a \emph{continuing process of \textbf{renewal}} based on the natural laws that govern human growth and progress. It's an \emph{\textbf{upward spiral} of growth} that leads to progressively higher forms of \emph{responsible} \textbf{\emph{independence}} and \emph{effective} \emph{\textbf{interdependence}}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Seven Habits -- An Overview}
\subsubsection{``Habits" Defined}
\begin{itemize}
\item For our purposes, we will define a \emph{\textbf{habit}} as the intersection of \emph{knowledge}, \emph{skill}, and \emph{desire}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Knowledge}} is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. 
\item \emph{\textbf{Skill}} is the how to do. 
\item And \emph{\textbf{desire}} is the motivation, the want to do.
\end{itemize}
 In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Maturity Continuum}
\begin{itemize}
\item Our growth from infancy to adulthood is in accordance with natural law. And there are many dimensions to growth. Reaching our full physical maturity, for example, does not necessarily assure us of simultaneous \emph{\textbf{emotional} or \textbf{mental maturity}}. On the other hand, a person's \emph{physical dependence} does not mean that he or she is mentally or emotionally immature.

\item On the \emph{\textbf{maturity continuum}}, 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{dependence}} is the paradigm of \emph{\textbf{you}} -- you take care of me; you come through for me; you didn't come through; I blame you for the results.
\item \emph{\textbf{Independence}} is the paradigm of \emph{\textbf{I}} -- I can do it; I am responsible; I am self-reliant; I can choose.
\item \emph{\textbf{Interdependence}} is the paradigm of \emph{\textbf{we}} -- we can do it: we can cooperate; we can combine our talents and abilities and create something greater together.
\end{itemize}

\item Dependent people \textit{need} others to get what they want. Independent people can get what they want through \emph{their own effort}. Interdependent people \emph{combine} \emph{their own} efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.

\item If I were independent, \emph{\textbf{physically}}, I could pretty well make it \emph{\textbf{on my own}}. 

\emph{\textbf{Mentally}}, I could think \emph{my own thoughts}, I could move from one level of abstraction to another. I could think creatively and analytically and organize and express my thoughts in understandable ways.

\emph{\textbf{Emotionally}}, I would \emph{be validated from within}. I would be inner directed. My sense of \emph{worth} would not be a function of being liked or treated well.

\item True independence of character empowers us to \emph{\textbf{act}} rather than \emph{\textbf{be acted upon}}.

\item Independence is a major achievement in and of itself. But independence is not supreme. 

\item Independent thinking alone is not suited to \emph{\textbf{interdependent reality}}. Independent people who do not have the maturity to think and act interdependently may be good individual producers, but they won't be good leaders or team players. They're not coming from the paradigm of interdependence necessary to succeed in marriage, family, or organizational reality.

\item \emph{\textbf{Life}} is, by nature, highly \emph{\textbf{interdependent}}. 

\item \emph{Interdependence} is a far more mature, more advanced concept. 

If I am physically interdependent, I am self-reliant and capable, but I also realize that you and I working together can accomplish far more than, even at my best, I could accomplish alone. 

If I am emotionally interdependent, I derive a great sense of worth within myself, but I also recognize the need for love, for giving, and for receiving love from others.

If I am intellectually interdependent, I realize that I need the best thinking of other people to join with my own.

\item \emph{\textbf{Interdependence}} is a choice \emph{only \textbf{independent} people can make}. Dependent people cannot choose to become interdependent. They don't have the character to do it; they don't own enough of
themselves.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Effectiveness Defined}
\begin{itemize}
\item A paradigm of effectiveness that is in harmony with a natural law, a principle I call the ``\emph{\textbf{P/PC Balance}}." 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{P} stands for \emph{\textbf{Production}},
\item  and \textbf{PC} stands for \emph{\textbf{Production Capactity}}. 
\end{itemize}


\item True \emph{\textbf{effectiveness}} is a function of two things: 
\begin{itemize}
\item what is \emph{produced} (the \emph{production})
\item  and the producing \emph{asset} or \emph{capacity} to produce (the \emph{production capacity})
\end{itemize}

\item Effectiveness lies in the \emph{balance}. Focusing only on production will leave no assets to produce; focusing only on production capacity will fail to produce enough to maintain yourself or the capacity.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Three Kinds of Assets}
\begin{itemize}
\item Basically, there are three kinds of assets: \emph{\textbf{physical}}, \emph{\textbf{financial}}, and \emph{\textbf{human}}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{physical assets}: house, car, personal belongings, our body or our environment. 
\item \emph{financial assets}: income, job, experience, skills, education, \emph{our capacity to earn}, 
\item \emph{human assets}: trust, responsibility, marriage, child-parent, other human relationships, 
\end{itemize}

\item In the human area, the P/PC Balance is equally fundamental, but even more important, because
people control physical and financial assets.

\item Examples in marriage, in child education.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Organizational PC}
\begin{itemize}
\item One of the immensely valuable aspects of any correct principle is that it is \emph{valid} and \emph{applicable} in a wide variety of circumstances. 

\item When people fail to respect \emph{the P/PC Balance} in their use of \emph{\textbf{physical}} assets in organizations, they decrease organizational effectiveness and often leave others with dying geese.

\item \emph{The P/PC Balance} is particularly important as it applies to the \emph{\textbf{human}} assets of an organization -- the \emph{customers} and the \emph{employees}.

\item There are organizations that talk a lot about the customer and then completely neglect the people that deal with the customer -- the employees. The \emph{PC principle} is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to treat your best customers.

\item Effectiveness lies in the balance. 

Excessive focus on P results in ruined health, worn-out machines, depleted bank accounts, and broken relationships. 

Too much focus on PC is like a person who runs for three or four hours a day, bragging about the extra 10 years of life it creates, unaware he's spending them running. Or a person endlessly going to school, never producing, living on other people's golden eggs -- the eternal student syndrome.

\item To maintain \emph{the P/PC Balance} is often a difficult judgment call. But I suggest it is the very essence of effectiveness. It balances short term with long term. 

\item The P/PC Balance is the very essence of effectiveness. It's validated in every arena of life. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{How to Use This Book and What You Can Expect}
\begin{itemize}
\item Before we begin work on the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, I would like to suggest two
Paradigm Shifts that will greatly increase the value you will receive from this material:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, I would recommend that you not ``see" this material as a book.  You may choose to read it completely through once for a sense of the whole. But the material is designed to be a companion in the continual process of change and growth. It is organized
\emph{incrementally} and with suggestions for application at the end of each habit so that you can study and
\emph{focus on any particular habit} as you are ready.

As you progress to deeper levels of understanding and implementation, you can \emph{go back} time and again to the principles contained in each habit and work to expand your knowledge, skill, and desire.

\item Second, I would suggest that you shift your paradigm of your own involvement in this material
from the role of learner to that of teacher. Take an Inside-Out approach, and read with the purpose in
mind of \emph{\textbf{sharing}} or \emph{\textbf{discussing}} what you learn with someone else within 48 hours after you learn it.
\end{itemize}

\item If you decide to open your ``gate of change" to really understand and live the principles embodied in
\emph{the Seven Habits}, I feel comfortable in assuring you several positive things will happen.
\begin{itemize}
\item First, your \emph{\textbf{growth}} with be \emph{\textbf{evolutionary}}, but \emph{\textbf{the net effect}} will be \emph{\textbf{revolutionary}}. 

The net effect of opening the "gate of change" to the first three habits -- the habits of \emph{\textbf{Private Victory}} -- will be significantly increased \emph{\textbf{self-confidence}}. 

As you live your values, your sense of \emph{\textbf{identity}}, \emph{\textbf{integrity}}, \emph{\textbf{control}}, and \emph{\textbf{inner-directedness}} will infuse you with both exhilaration and peace. You will \emph{\textbf{define yourself from within}}, rather than by \emph{people's opinions} or by comparisons to others. ``Wrong" and ``right" will have little to do with being found out.

Ironically, you'll find that as you care less about what others think of you; you will \emph{care more about what \textbf{others} think of \textbf{themselves} and their \textbf{worlds}}, including their relationship with you. You'll no longer \emph{build} your emotional life \emph{on} other people's weaknesses. In addition, you'll find it easier and more desirable to \emph{\textbf{change}} because there is something -- \emph{\textbf{some core deep within}} -- that is essentially \emph{\textbf{changeless}}.

\item As you open yourself to the next three habits -- the habits of \emph{\textbf{Public Victory}} -- you will discover and unleash both the desire and the resources to \emph{heal and rebuild important relationships} that have \emph{deteriorated}, or even broken. \emph{\textbf{Good relationships} will \textbf{improve}} -- become deeper, more solid, more creative, and more adventuresome.

\item The seventh habit, if deeply \emph{internalized}, will \emph{\textbf{renew}} the first six and will make you truly independent and capable of effective interdependence. Through it, you can charge your own batteries.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Private Victory}
\subsection{Habit 1: Be Proactive -- Principles of Personal Vision}
\emph{\textbf{Self-awareness}} enables us to stand apart and examine even the way we ``see" ourselves -- our paradigm, the most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness. It affects not only our attitudes and behaviors, but also how we see other people. It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind.
\subsubsection{The Social Mirror}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the only vision we have of ourselves comes from \emph{\textbf{the social mirror}} -- from \emph{the current social paradigm} and from the opinions, perceptions, and paradigms of \emph{the people around us} -- our view of ourselves is like the reflection in the crazy mirror room at the carnival.

\item These visions are \emph{\textbf{disjointed}} and \emph{\textbf{out of proportion}}. They are often more projections than reflections, projecting the concerns and character weaknesses of \emph{people giving the input} \emph{rather than} accurately \emph{reflecting what we are}.

\item While we have acknowledged the tremendous power of \emph{\textbf{conditioning}} in our lives, to say that we are determined by it, that we have no control over that influence, creates quite a different map.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Between Stimulus and Response}
\begin{itemize}
\item The deterministic paradigm comes primarily from the study of animals. Our unique human endowments lift us above the animal world. The extent to which we exercise and develop these endowments empowers us to fulfill our uniquely human potential. \emph{\textbf{Between stimulus and response} is our greatest \textbf{power}} -- \emph{the \textbf{freedom} to choose}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{``Proactivity" Defined}
\begin{itemize}
\item In discovering the basic principle of the nature of man, Frankl described an accurate self-map from which he began to develop the first and most basic habit of a highly effective person in any environment, the habit of \emph{\textbf{Proactivity}}.

\item \emph{\textbf{Proactivity}} means more than merely \textbf{\emph{taking initiative}}. It means that as human beings, we \emph{\textbf{are responsible} for our \textbf{own lives}}. Our \emph{\textbf{behavior}} is a function of our \emph{\textbf{decisions}}, \textbf{not} our \emph{\textbf{conditions}}. We can subordinate \emph{feelings} to \emph{values}. We have the \emph{initiative} and the \emph{responsibility} to make things happen.

\item \emph{Highly \textbf{proactive} people \textbf{recognize} that \textbf{responsibility}}. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling.

\item Because we are, by nature, \emph{proactive}, if our lives are a function of \emph{\textbf{conditioning}} and \emph{\textbf{conditions}}, it is because we have, by \emph{conscious decision} or \emph{by default}, \emph{\textbf{chosen}} to \emph{empower those things to control us}.

\item In making such a choice, we become \emph{\textbf{reactive}}. 

Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment. 

Reactive people are also affected by their \emph{social environment}, by the ``social weather." Reactive people build their emotional lives around the behavior of others, \emph{empowering the \textbf{weaknesses of other} people to \textbf{control} them}.

\item The ability to \emph{\textbf{subordinate} an \textbf{impulse} to a \textbf{value}} is the \emph{\textbf{essence}} of \emph{the proactive person}. Reactive
people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by \emph{\textbf{values}} -- carefully thought about, selected and internalized values.

I admit this is very hard to accept emotionally, especially if we have had years and years of
explaining our misery in the name of circumstance or someone else's behavior. But until a person can
say deeply and honestly, ``I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday," that person
cannot say, ``\emph{I choose otherwise}."

\item Our character, our basic identity, does not have to be hurt at all. In fact, our most difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge our character and develop \emph{the \textbf{internal powers}}, the \emph{\textbf{freedom}} to \emph{handle difficult circumstances} in the future and to inspire others to do so as well.

\item Viktor Frankl suggests that there are \emph{\textbf{three central values}} in life -- 
\begin{itemize}
\item the \textbf{\emph{experiential}}, or that which happens to us; 
\item the \textbf{\emph{creative}}, or that which we bring into existence; 
\item and the \textbf{\emph{attitudinal}}, or our \emph{response} in difficult circumstances such as terminal illness
\end{itemize}
What matters most is \emph{\textbf{how} we \textbf{respond} to what we \textbf{experience} in life}.

\item \emph{\textbf{Difficult circumstances} often create \textbf{Paradigm Shifts}}, whole new frames of reference by which people see the world and themselves and others in it, and what life is asking of them. Their larger perspective reflects the attitudinal values that lift and inspire us all.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Taking the Initiative}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Our basic nature is to \textbf{act}, and \textbf{not} \textbf{be acted upon}}. As well as \emph{enabling} us to \emph{\textbf{choose our response}} to particular circumstances, this empowers us to \emph{\textbf{create circumstances}}.

\item Taking initiative does not mean being \emph{pushy}, \emph{obnoxious}, or \emph{aggressive}. It does mean \emph{\textbf{recognizing our responsibility}} to make things happen.

\item Many people \emph{\textbf{wait for something to happen}} or \emph{\textbf{someone to take care of them}}. But people who end up with the good jobs are the \textbf{proactive} ones who are \emph{\textbf{solutions} to problems}, \emph{not problems themselves}, who \emph{\textbf{seize} the initiative} to do whatever is \emph{\textbf{necessary}}, \emph{\textbf{consistent} with correct \textbf{principles}}, to \emph{get the job \textbf{done}}.

\item \emph{Holding} people to the \emph{responsible} course is not demeaning; it is \emph{\textbf{affirming}}. By respecting the proactive nature of other people, we provide them with at least one clear, undistorted reflection from the social mirror.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Act or Be Acted Upon}
\begin{itemize}
\item It takes initiative to create t\emph{he P/PC Balance} of effectiveness in your life. It takes initiative to develop \emph{the Seven Habits}. As you study the other six habits, you will see that each depends on the development of your proactive muscles. Each puts the responsibility on you to act. 

If you wait to be acted upon, you \emph{\textbf{will be acted upon}}. And \emph{growth} and \emph{opportunity consequences} attend either road.

\item ``What is our response? What are we going to do? How can we exercise initiative in this situation?"

\item The \textbf{difference} between \emph{positive thinking} and \emph{\textbf{proactivity}}: \emph{\textbf{Proactivity did face reality}}. We faced the reality of the current circumstance and of future projections. But we also faced the reality that \emph{we had the \textbf{power} to \textbf{choose a positive response}} to those circumstances and projections. Not facing reality would have been to \emph{accept} the idea that what's happening in our environment had to determine us.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Listening to Our Language}
\begin{itemize}
\item Because our attitudes and behaviors flow out of our paradigms, if we use our self-awareness to examine them, we can often see in them the nature of our underlying maps. Our language, for example, is a very real indicator of the degree to which we see ourselves as proactive people.

\item The \emph{\textbf{language}} of reactive people \emph{absolves them of responsibility}. That language comes from a basic \emph{paradigm} of \emph{\textbf{determinism}}. And the whole spirit of it is \emph{the transfer of responsibility}.

\item A serious problem with reactive language is that it becomes a \emph{\textbf{self-fulfilling prophecy}}. People become \emph{reinforced} in the paradigm that they are \emph{determined}, and they produce evidence to support the belief. They feel increasingly victimized and out of control, not in charge of their life or their destiny.
They blame outside forces -- other people, circumstances, even the stars -- for their own situation.

\item Proactive people \emph{\textbf{subordinate feelings to values}}. Love, the feeling, can be recaptured.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Circle of Concern or Circle of Influence}
\begin{itemize}
\item Another excellent way to become more self-aware regarding our own degree of proactivity is to look at \emph{where} we focus our time and energy.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Circle of Concern}}: a wide range of \emph{concerns}; separate from things in which we have no particular mental or emotional involvement.

\item \emph{\textbf{Circle of Influence}}: within the Circle of Concerns, there are things that we have real \emph{control}.
\end{itemize}

Within the Circle of Concerns but \emph{\textbf{outside}} Circle of Influence, there are some things over which we have \emph{no real control} and \emph{others that we can do something about}. 

\item By determining which of these two circles is the focus of most of our time and energy, we can discover much about the degree of our proactivity.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Proactive}} people \emph{\textbf{focus}} their efforts in \emph{\textbf{the Circle of Influence}}. 
\item \emph{Reactive} people, on the other hand, \emph{focus} their efforts in \emph{the Circle of Concern}. They focus on the weakness of other people, the problems in the environment, and circumstances \emph{over which they have \textbf{no control}}. 

The negative energy generated by that focus, combined with neglect in areas they could do something about, causes their \emph{Circle of Influence} to \emph{\textbf{shrink}}.
\end{itemize}

\item As long as we are working in our \emph{Circle of Concern}, we empower the things within it to control us. We aren't taking the proactive initiative necessary to effect positive change.

\item It was only when we went to \emph{\textbf{work in our Circle of Influence}}, when we focused on our \emph{own paradigms}, that we began to create a \emph{\textbf{positive energy}} that changed ourselves and eventually influenced our son as well. By \emph{working} on ourselves instead of \emph{worrying about} conditions, we were able to
\emph{\textbf{influence} the conditions}.

\item Because of position, wealth, role, or relationships, there are some circumstances in which a person's Circle of Influence is \emph{\textbf{larger}} than his or her Circle of Concern. This situation reflects on a \emph{self-inflicted emotional myopia} -- another \emph{reactive selfish life-style} focused in \emph{the Circle of Concern}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Direct, Indirect, and No Control}
\begin{itemize}
\item The problems we face fall in one of three areas: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{direct control}} (problems involving our own behavior);
\item \emph{\textbf{indirect control}} (problems involving other people's behavior);
\item or \emph{\textbf{no contro}}l (problems we can do nothing about, such as our past or situational realities). 
\end{itemize}

\item \begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Direct control} problems} are solved by working on our \textbf{\emph{habits}} since they are within our Circle of Influence. See ``\emph{Private Victories}".

\item \emph{\textbf{Indirect control} problems} are solved by changing our \emph{\textbf{methods of influence}}. These are the ``\emph{Public Victories}"

\item \emph{\textbf{No control} problems} involve taking the responsibility to smile, to \emph{genuinely and peacefully \textbf{accept} these problems} and \emph{learn to \textbf{live with them}}, even though we don't like them.
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{Changing our habits}, \emph{changing our methods of influence} and changing the way we see our no control problems are all \emph{within our Circle of Influence}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Expanding Circle of Influence}
\begin{itemize}
\item It is inspiring to realize that \emph{in \textbf{choosing our response} to circumstance, we powerfully \textbf{affect} our circumstance}. 

\item This man focused on his \emph{Circle of Influence}. He was treated like a gofer, also. But he would do more than what was expected. He anticipated the president's need. He read with empathy the president's underlying concern, so when he presented information, he also gave his analysis and his recommendations based on that analysis.

\item There are some people who interpret ``proactive" to mean pushy, aggressive, or insensitive; but that isn't the case at all. Proactive people aren't pushy. They're \emph{smart}, they're \emph{value driven}, they \emph{read reality}, and they \emph{know what's needed}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The ``Have's" and the ``Be's"}
\begin{itemize}
\item One way to determine which circle our concern is in is to distinguish between the \emph{have's} and the \emph{be's}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{The Circle of Concern} is filled with the \emph{have's}.
\item \emph{The Circle of Influence} is filled with the \emph{be's}.
\end{itemize}

\item Anytime we think the problem is ``out there," that thought is the problem. We empower what's out there to \emph{control} us. The change paradigm is ``outside-in" -- what's out there has to change before we can change.

\item The \emph{\textbf{proactive}} approach is to change from the \emph{\textbf{Inside-Out}}: \emph{\textbf{to be} different}, and by being different, to \emph{\textbf{effect}} \emph{positive change} in what's out there -- I can be more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative.

\item It is so much easier to blame other people, conditioning, or conditions for our own stagnant situation. But we are responsible -- ``response-able" -- to control our lives and to powerfully influence our circumstances by working on be, on what we are.

\item If I really want to improve my situation, I can work on the one thing over which I have control -- myself. 

\item As proactive people, we can carry our own physical or social weather with us. We can be happy and accept those things that at present we can't control, while we focus our efforts on the things that we can.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The Other End of the Stick}
\begin{itemize}
\item Before we totally shift our life focus to our Circle of Influence, we need to consider two things in our \emph{Circle of Concern} that merit deeper thought -- \emph{\textbf{consequences}} and \emph{\textbf{mistakes}}.

\item While we are \emph{free to choose} our \emph{\textbf{actions}}, we are \emph{\textbf{not free} to choose the \textbf{consequences} of those actions}. \emph{\textbf{Consequences} are governed by natural \textbf{law}}. 

\item Our \emph{behavior} is governed by \emph{\textbf{principles}}. Living in \emph{\textbf{harmony}} with them brings \emph{\textbf{positive consequences}}; \emph{\textbf{violating}} them brings \emph{\textbf{negative consequences}}. We are free to choose our response in any situation, but in doing so, we choose the attendant consequence. ``\emph{When we pick up one end of the stick, we pick up the other.}"

\item Sometimes our choices have brought consequences we would rather have lived without. If we had the choice to make over again, we would make it differently. We call these choices \emph{\textbf{mistakes}}, and they are the second thing that merits our deeper thought.

\item For those filled with \emph{\textbf{regret}}, perhaps the most needful exercise of \emph{proactivity} is to realize that \emph{\textbf{past mistakes}} are also out there in \emph{\textbf{the Circle of Concern}}. We can't recall them, we can't undo them, we can't control the consequences that came as a result.

\item The proactive approach to a mistake is to \emph{\textbf{acknowledge} it \textbf{instantly}, \textbf{correct} it, and \textbf{learn} from it}.

\item But not to acknowledge a mistake, not to correct it and learn from it, \emph{is a mistake of \textbf{a different order}}. It usually puts a person on a self-deceiving, self-justifying path, often involving rationalization (rational lies) to self and to others. This \emph{\textbf{second} mistake}, this \emph{cover-up}, \emph{empowers the first}, giving it disproportionate importance, and causes far \emph{deeper injury to self}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Making and Keeping Commitments}
\begin{itemize}
\item At the very heart of our Circle of Influence is our ability to \emph{\textbf{make} and \textbf{keep} \textbf{commitments} and \textbf{promises}}. The commitments we make to ourselves and to others, and our \emph{\textbf{integrity}} to those commitments, is \emph{the essence and clearest manifestation of our proactivity}.

\item It is also the essence of our growth. Through our human endowments of \emph{\textbf{self-awareness}} and \emph{\textbf{conscience}}, we become conscious of areas of weakness, areas for improvement, areas of talent that could be developed, areas that need to be changed or eliminated from our lives. 

\item Then, as we recognize and use our \emph{\textbf{imagination}} and \emph{\textbf{independent will}} to act on that awareness -- making promises, setting goals,
and being true to them -- we \emph{build the strength of character}, the being, that makes possible every other positive thing in our lives.

\item It is here that we find two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives immediately. 
\begin{itemize}
\item We can make a promise -- and \textbf{keep} it. 
\item Or we can set a goal -- and \textbf{work to achieve} it.
\end{itemize}

\item As we make and keep commitments, even small commitments, we begin to establish an inner integrity that gives us the awareness of self-control and the courage and strength to accept more of the responsibility for our own lives. By making and keeping promises to ourselves and others, little by little, our honor becomes greater than our moods.

\item The power to \emph{make and keep commitments to ourselves} is the \emph{essence} of developing the basic habits of effectiveness. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Proactivity: the Thirty-Day Test}
\begin{itemize}
\item I would challenge you to test the principle of proactivity for 30 days. Simply try it and see what
happens. 

\item For 30 days work only in your \emph{Circle of Influence}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Make small commitments and keep them}.
\item \textbf{Be a light, not a judge}. Be a model, not a critic.  Look at the weaknesses of others with \emph{\textbf{compassion}}, not \emph{accusation}. The issue is your own \emph{chosen response} to the situation and what you \emph{should be doing}.
\item Be part of the \textbf{solution}, not part of the problem.
\end{itemize}
 
 \item We are responsible for our own effectiveness, for our own happiness, and ultimately, I would say, for most of our circumstances.
 
 \item Knowing that we are responsible -- "response-able" -- is \emph{\textbf{fundamental to effectiveness}} and to every other habit of effectiveness we will discuss.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind -- Principles of Personal Leadership}
\subsubsection{What It Means}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{To Begin with the End in Mind}} means to start with a clear understanding of your \emph{\textbf{destination}}. It means to know where you're going so that you better understand \emph{where you are now} and so that the \emph{steps} you take are always in \emph{the right direction}.

\item How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, and, keeping that picture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do what really matters most.

\item We may be very busy, we may be very \emph{efficient}, but we will also be truly \emph{\textbf{effective}} only when we \emph{\textbf{Begin with the End in Mind}}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{All Things are Created Twice}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``\emph{Begin with the End in Mind}" is based on the \emph{\textbf{principle}} that \emph{\textbf{all things are created twice}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item  There's a \emph{\textbf{mental}} or \emph{first} creation,
\item  and a \emph{\textbf{physical}} or \emph{second} creation to all things.
\end{itemize}


\item The carpenter's rule is ``\emph{measure twice, cut once}." You have to make sure that the \emph{\textbf{blueprint}}, the first
creation, is really what you want, that you've thought everything through. Then you put it into bricks and mortar. Each day you go to the construction shed and pull out the blueprint to get marching orders for the day. You Begin with the End in Mind.

\item The same is true with parenting.

\item To the extent to which we understand \emph{the principle of two creations} and accept the \emph{responsibility} for both, we \emph{\textbf{act within} and \textbf{enlarge} the borders of our \textbf{Circle of Influence}}. 

To the extent to which we do not operate in harmony with this principle and take charge of the first creation, we \emph{diminish} it.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{By Design Or Default}
\begin{itemize}
\item Not all first creations are \emph{by \textbf{conscious} \textbf{design}}.

\item In our personal lives, if we do not develop our own \emph{\textbf{self-awareness}} and become \emph{\textbf{responsible}} for \emph{first creations}, we \emph{empower other people and circumstances} outside our Circle of Influence to shape much of our lives \textbf{\emph{by default}}. 

\item Whether we are aware of it or not, whether we are in control of it or not, there is a first creation to every part of our lives. 

We are \emph{either} \emph{the \textbf{second} creation of our \textbf{own} proactive \textbf{design}}, or we are \emph{the second creation of other people's \textbf{agendas}}, of \emph{circumstances}, or of \emph{past habits}.

\item Habit 1 says, ``\emph{You are the creator}." Habit 2 \emph{is} the first creation.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Leadership And Management -- the Two Creations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Habit 2 is based on \emph{\textbf{principles} of \textbf{personal leadership}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Leadership}} is the \emph{\textbf{first}} creation.
\item \emph{\textbf{Management}} is the \emph{second} creation, which we'll discuss in the chapter on Habit 3. But leadership has to come first.
\end{itemize}

\item ``\emph{\textbf{Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things}}."
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Management}} is a \emph{bottom-line focus}. 
\item \emph{\textbf{Leadership}} deals with the \emph{top line}.
\end{itemize} 
Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.

\item We are more in need of a \emph{vision} or \emph{designation} and a \emph{compass} (\emph{a set of \textbf{principles} or \textbf{directions}}) and less in need of a \emph{road map}. 

\item \emph{\textbf{Effectiveness}} -- often even survival -- does not depend solely on how much \emph{effort} we expend, but on whether or not the effort we expend is in the \emph{right jungle}. And the metamorphosis taking place in most every industry and profession demands \emph{\textbf{leadership first and management second}}.

\item Efficient management without effective leadership is, as one individual phrased it, ``like straightening deck chairs on the Titanic." 
\emph{\textbf{No management success can compensate for failure in leadership}}. But leadership is hard because we're often caught in a \emph{\textbf{management paradigm}}.

In \emph{\textbf{management paradigm}}, one often thinks of control, efficiency, and rules instead of direction, purpose, and family feeling.

\item And leadership is even more lacking in our personal lives. We're into managing with efficiency, setting and achieving goals before we have even clarified our values.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Rescripting: Become Your Own First Creator}
\begin{itemize}
\item The two additional unique human endowments that enable us to expand our proactivity and to exercise personal leadership in our lives are \emph{\textbf{imagination}} and \emph{\textbf{conscience}}.

\item Through \emph{\textbf{imagination}}, we can \emph{\textbf{visualize}} the \emph{uncreated} worlds of \emph{\textbf{potential}} that lie within us.

Through \emph{\textbf{conscience}}, we can come in contact with \emph{universal laws or principles} with our own singular talents and avenues of contribution, and with the \emph{\textbf{personal guidelines}} within which we can most effectively develop them. 

\item Because we already live with many scripts that have been handed to us, the process of writing our own script is actually more a process of ``\emph{\textbf{rescripting}}," or \emph{Paradigm Shifting} -- of changing some of the ·basic paradigms that we already have. 

\item In developing our own \emph{\textbf{self-awareness}} many of us discover \emph{ineffective} scripts, \emph{deeply embedded habits} that are totally \emph{unworthy} of us, totally \emph{incongruent} with the things we \emph{really value} in life. 

Habit 2 says we don't have to live with those scripts. 

We are response-able to use our \emph{\textbf{imagination}} and \emph{\textbf{creativity}} to write new ones that are more effective, more congruent with our deepest values and with
the correct principles that give our values meaning.

\item \emph{To Begin with the End in Mind} means to approach \emph{\textbf{my role} as a parent}, as well as my \emph{other roles} in life, with my \emph{values} and \emph{directions} clear.

It also means to begin each day with those values firmly in mind. I don't have to \emph{react} to the emotion, the circumstance. I can be truly proactive, value driven, because my values are clear.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{A Personal Mission Statement}
\begin{itemize}
\item The most effective way I know to \emph{Begin with the End in Mind} is to develop a \emph{\textbf{personal mission statement}} or \emph{philosophy} or \emph{creed}. 

It focuses on what you \emph{\textbf{want to be}} (character) and \emph{\textbf{to do}} (contributions and achievements) and on the \emph{\textbf{values}} or \emph{\textbf{principles}} upon which being and doing are based.

\item A \emph{personal mission statement} based on correct principles becomes \emph{\textbf{personal constitution}}, the basis for making major, life-directing decisions, the basis for making daily decisions in the midst of the circumstances and emotions that affect our lives. It empowers individuals with the same \emph{\textbf{timeless strength}} in the midst of change.

\item People can't live with change if there's not a \emph{\textbf{changeless core}} inside them. The \emph{\textbf{key}} to the \emph{\textbf{ability to change}} is a \emph{\textbf{changeless} sense of who you are}, \emph{what you are about} and \emph{what you value}.

\item With a mission statement, we can \emph{\textbf{flow with changes}}. We don't need \emph{\textbf{prejudgments}} or \emph{\textbf{prejudices}}. We don't need to figure out everything else in life, to \emph{stereotype} and \emph{categorize} everything and everybody in order to accommodate reality.

\item Our personal environment is also \emph{\textbf{changing}} at an \emph{ever-increasing pace}. Such \emph{rapid change} burns out a large number of people who feel they can \emph{hardly handle} it, can \emph{hardly cope with} life. They become \emph{\textbf{reactive}} and essentially \emph{\textbf{give up}}, hoping that the things that happen to them will be good.

\item Once you have that sense of \emph{\textbf{mission}}, you have the essence of your \emph{own proactivity}. You have the \emph{vision} and the \emph{values} which direct your life. You have the basic direction from which you set your long- and short-term goals. You have the power of a written constitution based on correct principles, against which every decision concerning the most effective use of your time, your talents, and your energies can be effectively measured.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{At The Center}
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to write a \emph{personal mission statement}, we must begin at the very \emph{\textbf{center}} of our \emph{\textbf{Circle of Influence}}, that center comprised of our most basic \emph{Our \textbf{paradigms}}, the lens through which we see the world.

\item It is here that we deal with our \emph{\textbf{vision}} and our \emph{\textbf{values}}. 

\item It is also here that our focused efforts achieve the greatest results. As we work within the very \emph{center} of our \emph{Circle of Influence}, we \emph{\textbf{expand}} it.

\item Whatever is at the center of our life will be the source of our \emph{\textbf{security}}, \emph{\textbf{guidance}}, \emph{\textbf{wisdom}}, and \emph{\textbf{power}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Security}} represents your \emph{\textbf{sense} of \textbf{worth}}, your \emph{\textbf{identity}}, your \emph{\textbf{emotional anchorage}}, your \emph{\textbf{self-esteem}}, your \emph{basic \textbf{personal strength}} or lack of it.
\item \emph{\textbf{Guidance}} means your \emph{\textbf{source} of \textbf{direction in life}}. Encompassed by your map, your \emph{internal frame of reference} that interprets for you what is happening out there, are \emph{standards} or \emph{principles} or \emph{implicit criteria} that govern moment-by-moment decision-making and doing.
\item \emph{\textbf{Wisdom}} is your \emph{\textbf{perspective on life}}, your \emph{sense of \textbf{balance}}, your \emph{understanding} of \emph{\textbf{how}} the various parts and principles \emph{\textbf{apply}} and \emph{\textbf{relate to}} each other. It embraces \emph{judgment}, \emph{discernment}, \emph{comprehension}. It is a gestalt or oneness, an integrated wholeness.
\item \emph{\textbf{Power}} is the \emph{faculty} or \emph{\textbf{capacity} to \textbf{act}}, the \emph{\textbf{strength}} and \emph{\textbf{potency to accomplish}} something. It is the \emph{\textbf{vital energy}} to make choices and decisions. It also includes the \emph{capacity to overcome} deeply embedded habits and to cultivate higher, more effective ones.
\end{itemize}

\item These four factors -- \emph{security, guidance, wisdom, and power} -- are \emph{\textbf{interdependent}}. 

Security and clear guidance bring true wisdom, and wisdom becomes the spark or catalyst to release and direct power.

\item Your \emph{\textbf{security}} lies somewhere on the \emph{\textbf{continuum}} between extreme insecurity on one end, wherein your life is buffeted by all the fickle forces that play upon it, and a deep sense of \emph{high intrinsic worth} and \emph{personal security} on the other end. 

\item Your \emph{\textbf{guidance}} ranges on the \emph{continuum} from dependence on \emph{the social mirror} or other unstable, fluctuating sources to \emph{strong inner direction}. 

\item Your \emph{\textbf{wisdom}} falls somewhere between a totally inaccurate map where everything is \emph{distorted} and nothing seems to fit, and a complete and accurate \emph{\textbf{map of life}} wherein all the parts and \emph{principles} are properly related to each other.

\item Your \emph{\textbf{power}} lies somewhere between immobilization or being a \emph{puppet} pulled by someone else's strings to high \emph{\textbf{proactivity}}, \emph{the power to act} according to \emph{your own values} instead of \emph{being acted upon} by other people and circumstances.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Alterative Centers}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each of us has a center, though we usually don't recognize it as such.

\item Let's briefly examine several centers or core paradigms people typically have:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Spouse Centeredness}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{security}}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Your feelings of security are based on the way your spouse treats you.
\item You are highly vulnerable to the moods and feelings of your spouse.
\item There is deep disappointment resulting in conflict when your spouse disagrees with you or does not meet your expectations.
\item Anything that may impinge on the relationship is perceived as a threat. 
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{guidance}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your direction comes from your own needs and wants and from those of your spouse.
\item Your decision-making criterion is limited to what you think is best for your marriage or your mate, or to the preference and opinions of your spouse.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{wisdom}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your life perspective surrounds things which may positively or negatively influence your spouse or your relationship.
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{power}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your power to act is limited by weakness in yourself and your spouse.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{Family Centeredness}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{security}}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Your security is founded on family acceptance and fulfilling family expectations.
\item Your sense of personal security is as volatile as the family.
\item Your feeling of family worth are based on the family reputation.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{guidance}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Family scripting is your source of correct attitudes and behaviors.
\item Your decision-making criterion is what is good for the family, or what family members want.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{wisdom}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your interpret all of life in terms of your family, creating a partial understanding and family nasrcissism.
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{power}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your actions are limited by family models and traditions.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{Money Centeredness}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{security}}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Your personal worth is determined by your net worth.
\item You are vulnerable to anything that threatens your economic security.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{guidance}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Profit is your decision-making criterion.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{wisdom}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Money-making is the lens through which life is seen and understood, creating imbalanced judgment.
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{power}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item You are restricted to what you can accomplish with your money and your limited vision.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{Work Centeredness}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{security}}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item You tend to define yourself by your occupational role.
\item You are only comfortable when you are working.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{guidance}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item You make your decisions based on the needs and expectations of your work.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{wisdom}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item You tend to be limited to your work role.
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{power}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your actions are limited by work role models, organizational constraints, occupational opportunities, your boss's perceptions, and your possible inability at some point in your life to do that particular work.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{Possession Centeredness}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{security}}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Your security is based on your reputation, your social status, or the tangible things you possess.
\item You tend to compare what you have to what others have.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{guidance}}:

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{Pleasure Centeredness}}.

\item \emph{\textbf{Friend Centeredness}}.

\item \emph{\textbf{security}}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Your security is a function of the social mirror.
\item You are highly dependent on the opinions of others.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{guidance}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your decision criterion is ``What will they think?"
\item You are easily embarrassed.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{wisdom}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item You see the world through a social lens.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{power}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your ability to act is limited to your own resources, without the benefits of interdependency.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Identify Your Center}
\begin{itemize}
\item Perhaps the best way to identify your own center is to look closely at \emph{your \textbf{life-support factors}}. If you can identify with one or more of the descriptions above, you can trace it back to the center from which it flows, a \emph{center} which may be \emph{\textbf{limiting} your \textbf{personal effectiveness}}.

\item More often than not, a person's center is some \emph{\textbf{combination}} of these and/or other \emph{centers}. 

\item Most people are very much a function of \emph{a variety of influences} that play upon their lives. Depending on
\emph{external or internal conditions}, \emph{one particular center} may be \emph{activated} until the underlying needs are satisfied. Then another center becomes the compelling force.

\item The \emph{\textbf{ideal}}, of course, is to \emph{create} \emph{one clear center} from which you \emph{consistently} derive a high degree of security, guidance, wisdom, and power, empowering your proactivity and giving congruency and harmony to every part of your life.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{A Principle Center}
\begin{itemize}
\item By \textbf{centering} our lives on \emph{\textbf{correct}} \emph{\textbf{principles}}, we create a solid foundation for development of the four life-support factors. 

\item \emph{\textbf{Correct principles do not change}}. We can depend on them.

\item \emph{Principles} don't \emph{\textbf{react}} to anything. They don't \emph{\textbf{depend}} on the behavior of \emph{others}, the \emph{environment}, or the \emph{current fad} for their \emph{\textbf{validity}}. Principles don't \emph{die}.

\item Principles are \emph{\textbf{deep}, \textbf{fundamental truths}}, classic truths, generic common denominators.

\item Even in the midst of people or circumstances that seem to ignore the principles, we can be \emph{\textbf{secure} in the knowledge} that \emph{principles are bigger than people or circumstances}.

\item Admittedly, we're not omniscient. Our \emph{knowledge} and \emph{understanding} of correct principles is \emph{\textbf{limited}}.

\item We are limited, but \emph{we can \textbf{push back} the borders of our limitations}. 

\item The \emph{\textbf{wisdom}} and \emph{\textbf{guidance}} that accompany \emph{principle-centered living} come from \emph{correct maps}, from the way things really are, have been, and will be.  \emph{\textbf{Correct maps}} enable us to clearly see where we want to go and how to get there. We can make our decisions using the \emph{correct data} that will make their implementation possible and meaningful.

\item The personal \emph{\textbf{power}} that comes from principle-centered living is the power of a \emph{\textbf{self-aware}}, \emph{\textbf{knowledgeable}}, \emph{\textbf{proactive}} individual, \emph{unrestricted} by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of \emph{others} or by many of the \emph{circumstances} and \emph{environmental influences} that \emph{limit} other people.

\item The only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves. We are free to choose our actions, based on our knowledge of correct principles, but we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.

\item By centering our lives on \emph{timeless, unchanging principles}, we create a \emph{\textbf{fundamental paradigm} of \textbf{effective living}}. It is the \emph{center} that puts all \emph{other centers} in perspective.

\item Remember that your \emph{\textbf{paradigm}} is the \emph{source} from which your \emph{\textbf{attitudes}} and \emph{\textbf{behaviors}} flow.

\item \emph{\textbf{Principle Centeredness}}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{security}}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Your security is based on \emph{\textbf{correct principles}} that \emph{\textbf{do not change}}, regardless of external conditions or circumstances.
\item You know that true principles can r\emph{epeatedly be validated} in your own life, through your own experiences.
\item As a measurement of self-improvement, correct principles function with \emph{exactness}, \emph{consistency}, \emph{beauty} and \emph{strength}.
\item Correct principles help you understand your own \emph{development}, endowing you with the confidence to learn more, thereby increasing your knowledge and understanding.
\item Your source of security provides you with an \emph{immovable}, \emph{unchanging}, \emph{unfailing} \textbf{\emph{core}} enabling you to see change as an exciting adventure and opportunity to make significant contributions.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{guidance}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item You are guided by a \emph{\textbf{compass}} which enables you to see where you want to go and how you will get there.
\item You use \emph{accurate data} which makes your decisions both implementable and meaningful. 
\item You stand apart from life's situations, and circumstances and look at \emph{\textbf{the balanced whole}}. 
\item Your decisions and actions reflect both \emph{short and long-term considerations} and implications.
\item In every situation, you \emph{consciously}, \emph{proactively} determine the best alternative, basing decisions on conscience educated by principles.
\end{itemize}
  
\item \emph{\textbf{wisdom}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your judgment encompasses a broad spectrum of \emph{long-term consequences} and reflects a \emph{wise balance} and quiet assurance.
\item You see things differently and thus you think and act differently from the largely \emph{reactive} world.
\item You \emph{\textbf{view}} the world through a \emph{\textbf{fundamental paradigm}} for effective, provident living.
\item You see the world in terms of what you can do for the world and its people.
\item You adopt a \emph{\textbf{proactive lifestyle}}, seeking to serve and build others.
\item You interpret all of life's experiences in terms of \emph{opportunities for learning and contribution}.
\end{itemize}

\item \emph{\textbf{power}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your power is limited only by your understanding and observance of natural law and correct principles and by the natural consequences of the principles themselves.
\item You become a \emph{self-aware, knowledgeable, proactive individual}, largely unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, or actions of others.
\item Your ability to act \emph{reaches far beyond your own resources} and encourages highly developed levels of \emph{interdependency}.
\item Your decisions and actions are not driven by your current financial or circumstantial limitations.
\item You experience an \emph{\textbf{interdependent freedom}}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Writing and Using a Personal Mission Statement}
\begin{itemize}
\item As we go deeply within ourselves, as we understand and realign our basic paradigms to bring them in harmony with correct principles, we create both an effective, empowering center and a clear lens through which we can see the world. We can then focus that lens on how we, as unique individuals, relate to that world.

\item We \emph{\textbf{detect}} rather than \emph{invent} our \emph{missions in life}. 

Each of us has an internal monitor or sense, a \emph{\textbf{conscience}}, that gives us an \emph{awareness} of our own uniqueness and the singular contributions that we can make.

\item In seeking to give verbal expression to that uniqueness, we are again reminded of the \emph{fundamental importance} of \emph{\textbf{proactivity}} and of working \emph{\textbf{within}} our \emph{\textbf{Circle of Influence}}. 

\item Man should not ask what the \emph{\textbf{meaning}} of his life is, but rather must recognize that \emph{it is \textbf{he} who is asked}. In a word, each
man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by \emph{\textbf{answering} for his own life}; to life he can only respond by being \emph{\textbf{responsible}}.

\item \emph{\textbf{Personal responsibility}}, or \emph{\textbf{proactivity}}, is fundamental to the first creation. Habit 1 says ``You are the programmer." Habit 2, then, says, ``Write the program."

\item A \textbf{mission statement} is not something you write overnight. It takes \emph{deep introspection, careful analysis, thoughtful expression}, and often \emph{\textbf{many rewrites}} to produce it in final form.

Even then, you will want to \emph{\textbf{review}} it \emph{\textbf{regularly}} and \emph{make minor changes} as the years bring additional insights or \textit{changing circumstances}.

\item I find the \emph{process} is as important as the \emph{product}. Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes you because it forces you to think through your priorities deeply, carefully, and to align your behavior with your beliefs. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Using Your Whole Brain}
\begin{itemize}
\item Our \emph{\textbf{self-awareness}} empowers us to examine our own thoughts. This is particularly helpful in creating a personal mission statement because the two unique human endowments that enable us to practice Habit 2 -- \emph{\textbf{imagination}} and \emph{\textbf{conscience}} -- are primarily functions of the right side of the brain.

Understanding how to tap into that \emph{\textbf{right brain capacity}} greatly increases our \emph{first-creation ability}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Two Ways to Tap the Right Brain}
\begin{itemize}
\item The quality of our first creation is significantly impacted by our ability to use our creative right brain.

\item The two ways to tap the right brain:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Expand Perspective}}
\item \emph{\textbf{Visualization}} and \emph{\textbf{Affirmation}}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Expand Perspective}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes we are knocked out of our left-brain environment and thought patterns and into the right brain by an \emph{\textbf{unplanned experience}}. 

\item If you're \emph{\textbf{proactive}}, you \emph{don't have to wait} for circumstances or other people to create perspective-expanding experiences. You can \emph{\textbf{consciously} \textbf{create your own}}.

\item Expand your mind. \emph{Visualize} in rich detail. Involve as many emotions and feelings as possible. Involve as many of the senses as you can.

\item Things are suddenly placed in a \emph{different perspective}. \emph{\textbf{Values} quickly \textbf{surface}} that before weren't even recognized.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Visualization and Affirmation}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Personal leadership}} is not a singular experience. It doesn't begin and end with the writing of a \emph{personal mission statement}. 

\item It is, rather, the \emph{\textbf{ongoing process}} of keeping your \emph{vision} and \emph{values} before you and \emph{aligning} your life to be congruent with those most important things.

\item And in that effort, your powerful right-brain capacity can be a great help to you on a daily basis as you work to \emph{\textbf{integrate}} your personal mission statement \emph{into your life}. It's another application of ``\emph{Begin with the End in Mind}."

\item A good \textbf{\emph{affirmation}} has five basic ingredients:
\begin{itemize}
\item  it's \emph{\textbf{personal}},
\item  it's \emph{\textbf{positive}},
\item  it's \emph{\textbf{present tense}},
\item  it's \emph{\textbf{visual}}, 
\item and it's \emph{\textbf{emotional}}. 
\end{itemize}

\item The more clearly and vividly I can imagine the detail, the more deeply I will experience it, the less I will see it as a spectator.

\item \emph{Affirmation} and \emph{visualization} are forms of \emph{\textbf{programming}}, and we must be certain that we do not submit ourselves to any programming that is not \emph{\textbf{in harmony with}} our basic \emph{\textbf{center}} or that comes from \emph{sources} centered on money-making, self interest, or anything other than \emph{correct principles}.

\item  I believe the higher use of \emph{\textbf{imagination}} is \emph{in harmony with} the use of \emph{\textbf{conscience}} to \emph{transcend self} and create a \emph{life of contribution} based on unique purpose and on the \emph{principles} that govern \emph{\textbf{interdependent reality}}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Identifying Roles and Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item We each have a number of \emph{\textbf{different roles}} in our lives -- different areas or capacities in which we have \emph{\textbf{responsibility}}. And each of these roles is important.

\item One of the major problems that arises when people work to become more effective in life is that they don't \emph{\textbf{think broadly}} enough. 

They lose the sense of \emph{proportion}, the \emph{balance}, the natural \emph{ecology} necessary to effective living.

\item You may find that \emph{\textbf{your mission statement}} will be much more \emph{\textbf{balanced}}, much easier to work with, if you \emph{\textbf{break it down} into the \textbf{specific role} areas of your life} and the \emph{\textbf{goals}} you want to accomplish in \emph{each}
area. 

\item Writing your mission in terms of the important \emph{roles} in your life gives you \emph{\textbf{balance}} and \emph{\textbf{harmony}}. It keeps each role clearly before you. You can \emph{\textbf{review}} your roles \emph{frequently} to make sure that you don't get totally absorbed by one role to the exclusion of others that are equally or even more important in your life.

\item After you identify your various roles, then you can think about \emph{\textbf{the long term goals}} you want to accomplish in each of those roles. 

\item If these goals are the extension of a mission statement based on correct principles, they will be vitally different from the goals people normally set. They will be in
harmony with correct principles, with natural laws, which gives you greater power to achieve them. They are your goals. They reflect your deepest
values, your unique talent, your sense of mission. And they grow out of your chosen roles in life.

\item \emph{\textbf{An effective goal}} \emph{focuses} primarily on \emph{\textbf{results}} rather than \emph{activity}. It identifies where you want to
be, and, in the process, helps you determine where you are. It gives meaning and purpose to all you do.

\item \textit{\textbf{Roles} and \textbf{goals}} give \emph{\textbf{structure}} and \emph{\textbf{organized direction}} to your \emph{personal mission}.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Organizational Mission Statements}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\textbf{Mission statements}} are also vital to successful organizations. 

\item One of the \emph{\textbf{fundamental problems}} in organizations, including families, is that people are \emph{\textbf{not committed to}} the determinations of other people for their lives. They simply \emph{don't buy into them}.

\item Many times as I work with organizations, I find people whose goals are totally different from the goals of the enterprise. I commonly find reward systems completely out of alignment with stated value systems.

\item \emph{\textbf{Without involvement, there is no commitment}}. 

\item That's why creating an organizational mission statement \emph{takes time}, \emph{patience}, \emph{involvement}, \emph{skill}, and \emph{empathy}. Again, it's not a quick fix. It takes time and sincerity, correct principles, and the courage and integrity to align systems, structure, and management style to the shared vision and values. But it's based on correct principles and it works.

\item An organizational mission statement -- one that truly reflects the deep \emph{shared} vision and values of \emph{everyone within that organization} -- creates a great unity and tremendous commitment.
